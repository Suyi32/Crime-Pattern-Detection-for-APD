170152495	3	On January 15th, 2017 at approximately 2254hrs, I, Officer Saintil, G was dispatched to a pedestrian robbery call at 664 Willoughby Way. Upon arrival I met with the two victims (William Henry and Jordan Varela) of the robbery who stated they had been robbed while walking home to their apartments. According to both victims, they were approached by three black males as they were walking up Willoughby Way towards Ralph McGill Blvd. They advised that all three black males appeared to be between the ages of 17 and 20 years old and wore dark clothing. In addition, they each appeared to stand between 5'8 and 5'10 in height. It is believed that the perpetrators were hiding across the street since they came out of no where as the victims strolled down the side walk.William Henry walked slighty in front of his room mate, Jordan Varela and was approached by the first perpetrator from the front who brandished a silver pistol. The subject wore a dark hoodie, but did not have a hoodie over his head. His hair was described as a buzz cut/mid-top fade. He approached with the gun pointed at Henry and said, "empty your pockets". Henry began to comply, but was not moving fast enough. The subject then stated, "Come on, move faster boy." He then began patting down Henry's pockets and took his wallet which had about $120 in cash, three credit cards, a set of keys, and a debit card. His Iphone was also taken During the time Henry was approached from the front, Varela was approached from the back-left from two other subjects. Varela advised that one of the two subjects brandished a black pistol that appeared to be a 9mm. The other subject watched from the left side. While the subject with the black pistol was recalled to have on a dark hoodie, it could not be recalled what the on-looker wore and all dark clothing. The subject pointed the weapon at Varela from the side and made the same request for pockets to be emptied. He too began patting Varela down and took his I-phone 6s, wallet, and a pack of cigarettes. His keys were somehow left behind by the perpetrators.After the victims were robbed, the subjects both began asking and stressing where the victims vehicles were parked. The victims responded that their vehicles were in their complex, but did not specify where. From there they were instructed to turn around and walk down the side-walk towards Ashley Lane and not look back. They complied and began walking. They believed the perpetrators left on foot in the opposite direction towards 660 Ralph Mcgill Blvd NE, but did not see specifically. There was no surveillance available and no other known witnesses. The victims were able to return home since Varela's keys were left behind by the perpetrators and not taken. They were able to call their banks and cancel the cards that were taken taken. Varela also tried to track his phone when he got home, but it could not be tracked since it was turned off. Henry did not have tracking set up on his phone and was unsure if it was still on.I further advised the victims to change the locks on their apartments doors since the perpetrators still had a set of keys. in addition, they were advised to immobilize their vehicles in the garage since access to their complex garage was also taken. There were no injuries of physical violence during the incident. Sgt Rainey was advised and Investigator, Epps (4313) was on scene. CID Unit#5636 was also on scene. Nothing further.
