170102892	4	On 1/10/2016 at approximately 11:00pm, I Ofc. Z. Strachan (Unit 1084) was returning home to Savannah Midtown Apartments, where I live in addition to serving as a city-approved courtesy officer to the location. After a check of the parking deck, I parked my marked patrol vehicle and entered the 2000 building on the second floor, proceeding down the stairwell leading to the mailroom area, located on the first floor of that building. The apartment complex has had several break-ins to the mailboxes, so in addition to checking my mail I was checking to make sure it hadn't happened again. On at least two occasions, several access doors covering a bank of mailboxes have been found pried open and loose mail from several apartments has been found in the restrooms located on the rooftop (8th floor) outside of the fitness center. The leasing manager, Jennifer Taylor, has been in contact with the U.S. Postal Inspectors regarding the thefts.On my way down the stairs, I encountered a black female carrying mail and packages in both arms coming up the stairs, including several pieces of the weekly coupon mailers sent to everyone. The next exit down this stairwell opens directly across from the mailroom. I stopped the female and began to question her about the mail she was carrying. The female stated she lived there, and acted offended that I was asking her any questions. I informed her we'd been having problems with mail theft and I was trying to verify she lived there. She looked into her pile of mail and picked out an envelope addressed to Lounceny Kaba, of apartment 3308, looked at it and handed it to me. When I asked for another piece of mail or any identification to verify who she was, she again protested about being questioned, and I again stated she should have no problem helping me keep the community safe. She then stated that her boyfriend was cheating on her and she was just trying to track him down. Before I could ask how that related to the mail she was carrying or verifying who she was, she shifted the arm load of mail, causing a yellow plastic-handled, flat head screwdriver to fall to the ground between us.I immediately grabbed her and turned her around, facing the nearest wall, attempting to detain her. The female placed her hands behind her back, explaining that she was "cooperating, but you're scaring me." While her hands were behind her back, she continued to turn, looking over her right shoulder and angling her body toward the down stairs. As I moved to place the handcuffs on her, she pushed backwards and ran down the stairs, turning down the hallway that led to an exit at the east end of the building. I attempted to catch up to her, knowing she was coming up to two exit gates that each had "push to exit" buttons. The female went through the door at the end of the hallway, attempting to push it closed behind her. I followed through in time to see her hit the first exit button and go through the gate. She exited the building into an enclosed courtyard and immediately turned left, where there was another pedestrian gate leading out of the fenced area of the complex and towards the roadway. She hit the exit button and went through, again attempting to slam the gate behind her. At that time, I deployed my city-issued Taser, which got caught in the gate and did not make contact. At this time, I got on the radio and notified dispatch that a female was running from me and gave the description (black female, short black hair, approximately 5'9", black coat with a fur-lined collar, black pants). She continued through the front lot and directly into North Avenue, at a location where the eastbound lanes are just after a hill crest and on the downhill slope headed for the next intersection. The female ran diagonally across North Avenue towards Penn Avenue and into the parking deck at Camden Midtown Apartments. At this time, I was becoming tired and falling further and further behind the female. I lost sight of her as she en

Spring Street is a one way street running southbound. Sgt Wolfe stated that the vehicle did not yield at the intersection even though she did not have any traffic lights because she was going the wrong way on the one way street. Once the vehicle entered the intersection another vehicle, who had the green light traveling west on North Avenue, struck the vehicle traveling in the wrong direction. Sgt Wolfe informed me that the accident was recorded on his patrol car camera and that an incident was made. The incident is saved on the camera in vehicle 33414 on 1-8-2017 from 0216 to 0220. Grady EMS Unit 603 was on scene checking the drivers and passenger.After speaking with Sgt Wolfe I spoke with Mr. Roderic Hunter who was driving vehicle 2. Mr. Hunter advised me that he was driving west on North Avenue when he saw headlights to his left. He tried to slam on the brakes to miss the vehicle traveling in the wrong direction, but could not avoid it and hit the vehicle. Mr. Hunter did not complain of any injuries and refused Grady EMS services. Mr. Hunter was given a copy of his case number for insurance purposes and his vehicle was towed privately.I then spoke with the driver of vehicle 1, Ms. Leasha Williams. Ms. Williams stated that she was driving and had the green light and that a vehicle came out of no where and hit her. I informed Ms. Williams that she was driving the wrong way on a one way street and Ms. Williams stated, "Really, oh well I didn't know. I was following my GPS and it told me to go that way." I could smell the strong odor of alcoholic beverages coming from Ms. Williams's breathe and asked her where she was coming from. Ms. Williams stated "Suite Lounge". (375 Luckie Street). I asked Ms. Williams to step out of the vehicle and turned my vehicle camera and grabbed my microphone pack from the vehicle. I had Ms. Williams step in front of my vehicle so that she could be recorded and asked Ms. Williams what she had to drink at the club. Ms. Williams stated "Two drinks". I asked what type of alcohol she was drinking and Ms. Williams stated "Kettle One." I asked if it was straight vodka and she stated "yes". After clarifying her reponse, Ms. Williams stated "No it had cranberry juice and orange juice in it". I asked how much vodka was in each drink and she responded "I don't know. Not enough to be drunk". I informed Ms. Williams that I was going to do field sobriety testing. I asked Ms .Williams if she was on any medications and she stated "yes, but nothing that I can't drink with". I then asked Ms. Williams if she was physically fine to do field sobriety testing and she stated "yes, I don't have any injuries and do not need Grady EMS". While speaking with Ms. Williams, she could not focus her gaze on me and her eyes were bloodshot. I then conducted the heel to toe walk. I explained the test to Ms. Williams step by step and asked if she understood the instruction which she stated "yes". While performing the heel to toe walk, Ms. Williams failed to touch her heel to her toe at all, walked completely off the straight line, walked ten steps instead of nine, and walk did not look down as instructed. After the heel to toe walk, I demonstrated and explained the one legged stand.

Ms. Gardner works as a security guard, and she stated that today around 1700 hrs Mr. James friend called him several times and they knocked at his door and he is not responding.

They both walked inside the apartment and discovered Mr. James laying in his bed unresponsive and not breathing, so they called for the ambulance. Grady 374 got on scene and found Mr. James rigid body on his bed. I raised Fulton County Medical Examiner Inv. Clint Harbin, who came on the scene and pronounced Mr. James dead of a natural death, due to his existing diabetes and high blood pressure condition. Inv Clint said that the death occured around 1000 hrs this morning due to the condition of the body. Mr. James next of kin was notified by phone. I informed Sgt Kellmer 3692 about the incident.

163641294	4	On 12/29/2016 at approximately 12:45PM, I (Ofc. H. Vernon/Unit #2504) responded to an Auto Accident call(Possible Injuries) in the area of 310 North Ave NW.Upon my arrival, I observed a vehicle (black 2011 Lincoln Navigator; GA Tag; RCS3429) on the sidewalk, with its front end up against the gate belonging to The Coca Cola Company. A witness (Todd Kelly; 678-571-4833) stated that he observed the vehicle on State St NW at the traffic light for North Ave NW. He stated the vehicle was there for approximately 20 minutes, and that when he took a closer look, the driver (Troy MURRELL) was slumped over the wheel. Mr. Kelley stated that he attempted to rouse Mr. MURRELL from outside the driver's window, but that the vehicle then rolled forward through the intersection and onto the opposite sidewalk, striking the gate.Upon my arrival, I checked on the driver. He was still slumped over, drooling and sweating excessively. The doors were locked and the vehicle was still in "Drive". The driver was not responding when officers and by-standers were banging on the window, so AFD Engine #15 attempted to force entry through the rear right window(damage was sustained from that action). After a couple of blows to the window, the driver woke up. He opened the door and we were able to get him to place the vehicle into "Park". Upon initial observation of the driver/Mr. Murrell, he had pinpoint pupils. Lt. Sturm(404-546-4415) of AFD Station #15 stated through his experience that that was indicative of Heroin usage. He stated he also saw track marks on Mr. Murrell's arms. He asked Mr. Murrell where his needles were, but Mr. Murrell said he had none. His speech seemed slightly slow at first, as if sleepy, then normal for the duration of conversation. Mr. Murrell stated that he was no under the influence of any drugs and did not take any medications. When asked if he had any medical conditions, he stated that he suffered from seizures (his last being about 8 months ago). When asked what happened before his collision, he stated that he "felt dizzy". When asked when the last time he used Heroin was, after pausing for a few moments, he stated that he could not remember, but denied using it on this date.Upon Ofc. Roberson's(Unit #2506) search of the vehicle for inventory before impounding it, he located plastic wrap twisted up with a rocky substance within on top of the gear shift panel in plain view, to the right of the driver's seat. Mr. Murrell stated that he did not what it was. Also, on the driver's floorboard was a soda can bottom cut-out. The bottom of it was charred and in the depression on top, appeared to be residue from suspected Heroin.The rocks were tested using the Narcotics Analysis Reagent Kit (NARK) II test. The instruction manual stated that "Heroin will generate a light green and gradually intensify/darken over the ensuing period of one minute". The substance did, in fact, turn light green and darken, indicating it was positive for Heroin.Mr. Murrell was transported to Grady Memorial Hospital by Grady Bus #651. Upon arrival, once he was relocated to the emergency intake area, he was informed that he was under arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Drugs. I read Implied Consent at this time for a blood test. Mr. Murrell consented to the test. A blood test was retrieved from City of Atlanta Corrections.

170352834	4	On 02-04-2017, around 2345, Officer Shelley and I, Sgt. D. Barr, were on North Avenue at Courtland Street.  We were stopped at a traffic light.  The only business open at this time is the JR Cricket's restaurant.  A pedestrian was walking into the parking lot but not towards the restaurant.  He was walking towards the dumpster area of the lot, where two other males were loitering.  This particular area is a heavy open sale and use area, mostly after dark. Officer Shelley and I were in a marked City of Atlanta Police vehicle.  We turned onto Willow Street and approached the 3 males in the parking lot from the far side.  They were stopped in the parking lot, away from any car and did not appear to have a car in the lot.  They were not close to or approaching any car, and no one had keys out.  It is a cold evening and the temperature is 38 degrees with a wind chill of 35. It was a light breeze.  Upon immediate site of the police, the three males separated.  They were standing, forming a triangle, with their hands out.  They were facing each other while leaning their heads forward.  They appeared to be involved in a transaction.  We stopped the patrol car in the parking lot and started to approach the males as they separated.  One of the males was wearing a snow mobile suit, blue in color.  He suddenly put his hand in his right pocket and was walking fast. I recognized him from 2 nights earlier, when I made a cocaine case at this same location. I told him to stop.  He did not and began to run.  I started in that direction, as I could smell a strong odor of raw marijuana.  The suspect ran to North Avenue and out into the street.  Officer Shelley drove by him in the patrol car and the suspect doubled back in a lane of traffic again and got by me to run back towards where he started.  The other 2 males were going in other directions.  This particular suspect was running with his hand in his right pocket, as if he a gun.  I felt that he was armed with a gun and his actions of blading and keeping his hand in his pocket while running is a common practice when pockets are oversized like a snowmobile suit.  I pulled out my tazer and discharged both sets.  None of the darts made contact with the skin.  Officer Shelley caught him and took him down.  He was cuffed.  He had a loaded 9mm Jennings pistol, a medium sized semi auto pistol.  It was in his right pocket. The pistol was loaded.  It did not come back as stolen.  The suspect was identified as Lanthonian Terrell Burch, Black Male, 02-17-1979.  He told us that he had the gun when he was cuffed. Mr. Burch is a convicted felon for a POSSESSION OF COCAINE conviction.  He has no permit to carry a concealed weapon. The odor of raw marijuana went away after a minutes.  Mr. Burch said that he had the gun, no weed.  The odor was there then it left.  At least 2 other officers stated that they could smell it but we did not locate any marijuana. Mr Burch did not have any injuries. Mr. Burch said that he ran because he had a gun and knows he is not supposed to. I advised radio of my tazer useage and talked to Sgt. Nelms 1594.  We all relocated to Spring Street precinct while Officer Shelley took out warrants.       While at the Spring Street precinct, Mr Burch requested to use the restroom.  He vollentarily told Officer Shelley that he did have a couple "Sacks " on him but did not know what happened to them in the foot chase/ arrest.

The area they were stood was not far from 589 Willow st where drugs are openly sold and used.  I have made a number of drug related arrests in this area.  I saw Burch meet up with two other individuals in the lot, I could tell that they didn't have a vehicle in the lot because of where they were stood and none of them had car keys out.  As Barr and I turned on to Willow st behind the J.R. Crickets lot I observed Burch and the two other males conducting a drug transaction with each other (hand to hand).  As soon as Burch saw us he began to walk away from the other two gentleman towards the restaurant.  It seemed as if Burch was trying to get out of our eye sight.  Sgt Barr exited our city of Atlanta patrol car to question him and immediatly smelt the strong odor of marijuana.  Barr told Burch to stop but he kept on walking and then took off running.  While running Burch held his right pocket.  His pockets were baggy and it appeared as if he was holding a gun in his pocket.  If someone runs with a gun in a baggy pocket it is natural for them to hold their pocket.  While Barr pursued him on foot I pursued him in my patrol vehicle.  Burch ran past the restaurant out into the street while traffic was present, as I caught up with him he doubled back to the parking lot.  I exited my patrol car and followed him on foot.  When I got level with Barr, Burch was still holding his right pocket, Barr deployed his tazer.  The thickness of Burches garments rendered the tazer ineffective.  I caught up with Burch and tackled him to the ground.  After handcuffing Burch, Burch stated "I have a gun in my right pocket."  I secured the weapon.  The weapon was a loaded "Bryco Arms, Jennings Nine" with nine bullets. and was not stolen.  After transporting Burch to the precinct Burch needed to use the restroom.  When I took him back he said that he had some bags of Marijuana on him and he needed to find them so that he wouldn't get into trouble for taking it to jail.  We searched but he stated that they must have fallen during the pursuit.  A criminal history check verified that Burch was a convicted felon.  Burch had previous felonies for Possession of Controlled Substances and Terroristic Threats.  I charged Burch accordingly.  I transported Burch to Fulton County Jail without incident.  Burch's two cell phones, cigarettes and 30.00 dollars cash was handed over to Alethea Jenkins (DOB01/19/1971) at Burch's request.  The Firearm was placed into property.
170352834	4	On 02-04-2017, around 2345, Officer Shelley and I, Sgt. D. Barr, were on North Avenue at Courtland Street.  We were stopped at a traffic light.  The only business open at this time is the JR Cricket's restaurant.  A pedestrian was walking into the parking lot but not towards the restaurant.  He was walking towards the dumpster area of the lot, where two other males were loitering.  This particular area is a heavy open sale and use area, mostly after dark. Officer Shelley and I were in a marked City of Atlanta Police vehicle.  We turned onto Willow Street and approached the 3 males in the parking lot from the far side.  They were stopped in the parking lot, away from any car and did not appear to have a car in the lot.  They were not close to or approaching any car, and no one had keys out.  It is a cold evening and the temperature is 38 degrees with a wind chill of 35. It was a light breeze.  Upon immediate site of the police, the three males separated.  They were standing, forming a triangle, with their hands out.  They were facing each other while leaning their heads forward.  They appeared to be involved in a transaction.  We stopped the patrol car in the parking lot and started to approach the males as they separated.  One of the males was wearing a snow mobile suit, blue in color.  He suddenly put his hand in his right pocket and was walking fast. I recognized him from 2 nights earlier, when I made a cocaine case at this same location. I told him to stop.  He did not and began to run.  I started in that direction, as I could smell a strong odor of raw marijuana.  The suspect ran to North Avenue and out into the street.  Officer Shelley drove by him in the patrol car and the suspect doubled back in a lane of traffic again and got by me to run back towards where he started.  The other 2 males were going in other directions.  This particular suspect was running with his hand in his right pocket, as if he a gun.  I felt that he was armed with a gun and his actions of blading and keeping his hand in his pocket while running is a common practice when pockets are oversized like a snowmobile suit.  I pulled out my tazer and discharged both sets.  None of the darts made contact with the skin.  Officer Shelley caught him and took him down.  He was cuffed.  He had a loaded 9mm Jennings pistol, a medium sized semi auto pistol.  It was in his right pocket. The pistol was loaded.  It did not come back as stolen.  The suspect was identified as Lanthonian Terrell Burch, Black Male, 02-17-1979.  He told us that he had the gun when he was cuffed. Mr. Burch is a convicted felon for a POSSESSION OF COCAINE conviction.  He has no permit to carry a concealed weapon. The odor of raw marijuana went away after a minutes.  Mr. Burch said that he had the gun, no weed.  The odor was there then it left.  At least 2 other officers stated that they could smell it but we did not locate any marijuana. Mr Burch did not have any injuries. Mr. Burch said that he ran because he had a gun and knows he is not supposed to. I advised radio of my tazer useage and talked to Sgt. Nelms 1594.  We all relocated to Spring Street precinct while Officer Shelley took out warrants.       While at the Spring Street precinct, Mr Burch requested to use the restroom.  He vollentarily told Officer Shelley that he did have a couple "Sacks " on him but did not know what happened to them in the foot chase/ arrest.

170350296	4	On 2/4/2017, I (Officer J. T. Thompson) was dispatched to 1079 North Ave NE Buddy's Food Mart.  Reporting party was Mr. MASUM, Md.  Mr. MASUM advised a young black male punched a trash can several times putting a dent on the lid of the trash can at the gas pump nearest the store.  The male was driving a small red car that had been parked at the gas pump facing North Ave NE.  Mr. MASUM advised there should be camera footage available during daytime hours.  Mr. MASUM advised he could not give a description of the male because he only saw him from a distance.  The car was a red car, but he did not know what type.  The car left West on North Ave NE.  There was minimal damage, but Mr. MASUM needed a police report for the store owner.  There is nothing further at this time.
170340280	4	On 02-03-2017, around 0145, I was at North Avenue at Piedmont Avenue, waiting at a long red light.  I noticed a SUV pull up in the parking lot of the JR Cricket's restaurant.  The passenger got out and walked across the street behind the business, Willow Street.  The SUV still had the driver inside but where they parked farther away from the open business than is normal, especially at nearly 2AM.  There were several empty parking spaces between the front door and the SUV.  The SUV did not appear to be in the parking lot to do business with the restaurant.  On Willow Street there was a small group of males loitering in the parking lot of the closed auto body shop.  This has been a serious problem lately and about 12 arrests have been made in the last 10 days involving drug use and that specific location.  I pulled my patrol car up next to the SUV and was talking to the driver as the passenger was talking to the guys in the other parking lot.  The driver appeared nervous and I explained the drug complaints and arrests that have been made at this location lately.  He said that he did not know that guy and only gave him a ride.  He got out of the vehicle, walked towards the restaurant then turned around and left.  The SUV driver said that he does not know what was going on , he was just giving a guy a ride and does not even know his name.  When the driver was leaving, the passenger was returning, walking towards the SUV and not the restaurant.  He noticed that the vehicle was leaving and I was now out of my patrol vehicle, he suddenly changed direction, towards the restaurant.  I approached him and we were talking about the problem of drug activity at this location.  I asked him if he had any narcotics on him or drug objects.  He was nervous and said "No". He was blading on me and touched his right pocket, turning his right side away from me and looking away.  This is ususally a sign of untruthfulness. He said that the driver of the SUV was his nephew.  I asked him If I could search his person and he did consent.  I checked his right pocket and located 1 hit of crack cocaine in a clear plastic baggy.  I showed it to him and he said, "I forgot I had that.. I put these pants on this morning and that must have been from earlier".  He ackowledged that he smokes crack and has been smoking crack earlier this date.  I asked him about going to rehab but he did not respond.  He said that he was not selling crack.    I obtained an arrest warrant from Fulton County Magistrate  EW-193537.  The male was identified as Richard Louis Stevens B/M 08-20-50.  He was transported to Fulton County Jail.  The suspected Cocaine was turned in to Atlanta Police property control to be analyzed.
170323145	4	On February 1st 2017, I Officer T. McCabe (Unit 1546) while on patrol in the midtown section of Atlanta observed a 2000 Black Ford Mustang Convertible (New Jersey Tag G44 GYY) driving on a City of Atlanta side walk while at the corner of West Peachtree Street and North Avenue. Upon stopping the vehicle successfully , and about approximately fifty feet from the entrance to MARTA subway station, I was able to make contact with the owner of the vehicle and the current driver who had lost control. Upon speaking with the owner Mr. Nazareth Neal (05/28/1998), I was informed that he was in the area looking for an ATM when he allowed his friend to take control of the vehicle as he exited.

Upon confronting Mr. King in regards to my findings, he confessed that he had lied. Mr. King admitted that his real name was Mr. Dadrian King (06/02/1990) and informed me that he was not a licensed driver. Upon confronting the owner of the vehicle Mr. Neal in regards to my finding he appeared to not be concerned over the facts.  Upon asking Mr. Neal about his purpose of being in the area, he could not provide a valid reason. I asked Mr. Neal If I could searched his vehicle, and he refused to grant permission. Upon walking around the vehicle, I took notice to handgun that was tucked under the rear section of the driver seat. Mr. Neal immediately stated "That the gun was not his", and granted me permission to search the status of the weapon on ACIC. Mr. Neal informed me that the gun belonged to his brother.The Gun was a black in color  9mm, Glock 17 Gen 4 (serial number ZYP 677). The gun had a green in color laser beam attached to the front slide. I was informed that the weapon had not been reported stolen at the time.    The weapon and the vehicle was turned over to the mother of Mr. Neal, Ms. Ospina -Barrero (02/13/1971) (732-682-2737).

170332603	4	On February 2, 2017 I Officer C. Munson, Officer H. Grimes and Officer  J. Fletcher were patrolling the area of Cameron Alexander Blvd. NW. at Vine St. NW. We observed the vehicle listed, a black Porsche Cayenne with a drive out license plate #21308047. We observed the vehicle traveling west on Cameron Alexander Blvd. NW. at a high rate of speed and then turn onto Sunset Ave NW, without using a turn signal. While trying to catch up to the vehicle to conduct a traffic stop, it was still traveling at a high rate of speed and then turned onto North Ave NW. without using its turn signal again. It was dark and the streets are poorly lit in this area. The streets are also very narrow with vehicles parked on the streets along side the curbs, making them difficult to travel on at the speed limit. There is also a lot of pedestrian foot traffic in the area. When we turned onto North Ave NW. I was able to activate our emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop to further investigate. The vehicle then ignored our emergency equipment on our patrol vehicle and turned into a narrow driveway next to an apartment complex at 710 North Ave NW. The vehicle then traveled all the way down the narrow driveway and came to a stop, where the driver side of the vehicle was inches away from the apartment complex wall. The driver, a slim black male with dreads and wearing a dark shirt, later identified as Mr. Derrick Douglas exited the vehicle and fled on foot. When Mr. Douglas exited the vehicle, he turned around and looked right at us. We then exited our marked patrol vehicle and gave chase on foot after Mr. Douglas. I was able to squeeze in between the vehicle and the wall and when I did, I saw Mr. Douglas running and turning the corner on the other side of the apartment complex. When I ran around the corner of the apartment complex, about fifteen to eighteen males started running from the porch of apartment 104, back towards North Ave NW. I observed that they had left the apartment door wide open and I heard loud movement coming from inside the apartment. I could also smell a very strong odor of RAW Marijuana and observed suspected narcotics in plain view inside the apartment. I then held the front of the apartment and advised Officer Grimes and Officer Fletcher what I had and while doing this, I could still hear movement in the back of the small apartment. Additional units arrived on scene and we then conducted a protective sweep of the apartment as I could still hear movement inside. We announced our entry into the apartment but received no reply. We located a medium sized grey pit bull in the rear bedroom but no persons were located inside the apartment. While conducting the protective sweep, Officer Grimes observed additional marijuana in a clear baggie and a scale in plain view on the kitchen counter. We then froze the scene, while waiting to obtain a search warrant for the apartment. While I was chasing Mr. Douglas, Officer Fletcher had exited our patrol vehicle and noticed a female passenger in the front passenger seat getting out of the suspect vehicle. The female started to yell that she had nothing to do with the situation. Officer Fletcher then noticed in a bottle of promethazine in the middle console of the vehicle in plain view. The female passenger was later identified as Ms. Are'mesia Mahone, who then spoke with Officer Fletcher. Ms. Mahone stated that she had nothing to do with Mr. Douglas running on foot from Police. Ms. Mahone stated that Mr. Douglas had just picked her up on Donald Lee Hollowell Pkwy NW. and she said that he had to run an errand in the "Bluff". Ms. Mahone then stated that they were being pulled over by police and he jumped out of the vehicle and ran on foot. Ms. Mahone stated that she did not know his name and only had his phone number. Ms. Mahone described him as a male with long black dreads and that he was wearing a dark beanie cap. Ms. Mahone agreed to come to the Atlanta Police Headquarters a

170332603	4	I Ofc D Fambro was dispatched to a reported 45V (case# 170332947), Upon my arrival I spoke to Mr. Derrick Douglas who advised that his car was stolen. I advised my supervisor of the information Mr. Douglas gave to me. APEX officers advised that Mr. Douglas was a suspect of interest and that his car was not stolen but left behind when Mr. Douglas fled from a traffic stop. I placed Mr. Douglas in restraints and transferred responsibility to the APEX unit.
170332603	4	On February 2, 2017 I Officer C. Munson, Officer H. Grimes and Officer  J. Fletcher were patrolling the area of Cameron Alexander Blvd. NW. at Vine St. NW. We observed the vehicle listed, a black Porsche Cayenne with a drive out license plate #21308047. We observed the vehicle traveling west on Cameron Alexander Blvd. NW. at a high rate of speed and then turn onto Sunset Ave NW, without using a turn signal. While trying to catch up to the vehicle to conduct a traffic stop, it was still traveling at a high rate of speed and then turned onto North Ave NW. without using its turn signal again. It was dark and the streets are poorly lit in this area. The streets are also very narrow with vehicles parked on the streets along side the curbs, making them difficult to travel on at the speed limit. There is also a lot of pedestrian foot traffic in the area. When we turned onto North Ave NW. I was able to activate our emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop to further investigate. The vehicle then ignored our emergency equipment on our patrol vehicle and turned into a narrow driveway next to an apartment complex at 710 North Ave NW. The vehicle then traveled all the way down the narrow driveway and came to a stop, where the driver side of the vehicle was inches away from the apartment complex wall. The driver, a slim black male with dreads and wearing a dark shirt, later identified as Mr. Derrick Douglas exited the vehicle and fled on foot. When Mr. Douglas exited the vehicle, he turned around and looked right at us. We then exited our marked patrol vehicle and gave chase on foot after Mr. Douglas. I was able to squeeze in between the vehicle and the wall and when I did, I saw Mr. Douglas running and turning the corner on the other side of the apartment complex. When I ran around the corner of the apartment complex, about fifteen to eighteen males started running from the porch of apartment 104, back towards North Ave NW. I observed that they had left the apartment door wide open and I heard loud movement coming from inside the apartment. I could also smell a very strong odor of RAW Marijuana and observed suspected narcotics in plain view inside the apartment. I then held the front of the apartment and advised Officer Grimes and Officer Fletcher what I had and while doing this, I could still hear movement in the back of the small apartment. Additional units arrived on scene and we then conducted a protective sweep of the apartment as I could still hear movement inside. We announced our entry into the apartment but received no reply. We located a medium sized grey pit bull in the rear bedroom but no persons were located inside the apartment. While conducting the protective sweep, Officer Grimes observed additional marijuana in a clear baggie and a scale in plain view on the kitchen counter. We then froze the scene, while waiting to obtain a search warrant for the apartment. While I was chasing Mr. Douglas, Officer Fletcher had exited our patrol vehicle and noticed a female passenger in the front passenger seat getting out of the suspect vehicle. The female started to yell that she had nothing to do with the situation. Officer Fletcher then noticed in a bottle of promethazine in the middle console of the vehicle in plain view. The female passenger was later identified as Ms. Are'mesia Mahone, who then spoke with Officer Fletcher. Ms. Mahone stated that she had nothing to do with Mr. Douglas running on foot from Police. Ms. Mahone stated that Mr. Douglas had just picked her up on Donald Lee Hollowell Pkwy NW. and she said that he had to run an errand in the "Bluff". Ms. Mahone then stated that they were being pulled over by police and he jumped out of the vehicle and ran on foot. Ms. Mahone stated that she did not know his name and only had his phone number. Ms. Mahone described him as a male with long black dreads and that he was wearing a dark beanie cap. Ms. Mahone agreed to come to the Atlanta Police Headquarters a

Derrick Douglas made a 911 call in reference to his vehicle being stolen. We were informed that he informed the responding officer that his vehicle was stolen from McDaniel st. He also informed the officer that a female was inside the vehicle and she was possibly taken against her will.Ofc. Williams and I then entered the recorded interview room on the 3rd floor located at Atlanta Police headquarters. Upon entering the room we immediately identified ourselves as police officers, we were also wearing city approved police wear with our name badge upon it. We had a small digital recorder on hand with us.Derrick was given a waive of counsel form in which he signed and initialed, he agreed to speak with us without having an attorney present.He was then asked what happened to his vehicle. He stated that he was hanging out in the area of McDaniel st. however he was unable to inform us of what time he was in that area. He stated the then parked on McDaniel st. and quickly went inside the corner store "speak easy". He stated that after a brief moment he returned to his vehicle and observed it being driven away. He stated that he did not know who took it. He then informed me that he had a female companion inside the vehicle that he met earlier on this day whom he only knows as "Keisha". He stated that he then went to his 'baby mother" apartment at 540 Humphries dr and contacted the police and informed them that his vehicle had just been stolen.I then asked him where his cell phone is, he stated his cell phone is at his 'baby mother' house at this time. I then asked him had he encountered any police officers today while driving his vehicle. Derrick then gave a brief pause and stated "yes I think so". He stated that he was driving in the area of north side dr enroute to visit his uncle 'Nigg" whom lives at the apartments located on North Ave. He stated that he drove down the entrance driveway of the complex and then parked and exited the vehicle. He stated that after exiting the vehicle he began to walk to the front apartment. He then stated that he observed multiple people running therefore he began to run as well. He informed us that he did not know why everyone was running; He stated that he is not sure what the female did whom was in the vehicle with him.At this time, I asked him did his vehicle really get stolen from McDaniel st. he responded "no". I informed him that he was observed by officers exiting the vehicle and immediately fleeing on foot after a traffic stop was initiated. He continued to state that he only ran because others in the area began to run. He was informed that we recovered his items such as cell phone and Identification from the vehicle. Derrick then again admitted that he did flee from the area; however it was only because everyone else was running.Female passenger Are'mesia Mahone 03/03/1991 provided us with a written statement of the incident. She also positively identified Derrick as the drive based upon a driver license photo. These statement forms were turned into police property as evidence.

170332603	4	I Ofc D Fambro was dispatched to a reported 45V (case# 170332947), Upon my arrival I spoke to Mr. Derrick Douglas who advised that his car was stolen. I advised my supervisor of the information Mr. Douglas gave to me.

I placed Mr. Douglas in restraints and transferred responsibility to the APEX unit.
170332603	4	On February 2, 2017 I Officer C. Munson, Officer H. Grimes and Officer  J. Fletcher were patrolling the area of Cameron Alexander Blvd. NW. at Vine St. NW. We observed the vehicle listed, a black Porsche Cayenne with a drive out license plate #21308047. We observed the vehicle traveling west on Cameron Alexander Blvd. NW. at a high rate of speed and then turn onto Sunset Ave NW, without using a turn signal. While trying to catch up to the vehicle to conduct a traffic stop, it was still traveling at a high rate of speed and then turned onto North Ave NW. without using its turn signal again. It was dark and the streets are poorly lit in this area. The streets are also very narrow with vehicles parked on the streets along side the curbs, making them difficult to travel on at the speed limit. There is also a lot of pedestrian foot traffic in the area. When we turned onto North Ave NW. I was able to activate our emergency equipment to conduct a traffic stop to further investigate. The vehicle then ignored our emergency equipment on our patrol vehicle and turned into a narrow driveway next to an apartment complex at 710 North Ave NW. The vehicle then traveled all the way down the narrow driveway and came to a stop, where the driver side of the vehicle was inches away from the apartment complex wall. The driver, a slim black male with dreads and wearing a dark shirt, later identified as Mr. Derrick Douglas exited the vehicle and fled on foot. When Mr. Douglas exited the vehicle, he turned around and looked right at us. We then exited our marked patrol vehicle and gave chase on foot after Mr. Douglas. I was able to squeeze in between the vehicle and the wall and when I did, I saw Mr. Douglas running and turning the corner on the other side of the apartment complex. When I ran around the corner of the apartment complex, about fifteen to eighteen males started running from the porch of apartment 104, back towards North Ave NW. I observed that they had left the apartment door wide open and I heard loud movement coming from inside the apartment. I could also smell a very strong odor of RAW Marijuana and observed suspected narcotics in plain view inside the apartment. I then held the front of the apartment and advised Officer Grimes and Officer Fletcher what I had and while doing this, I could still hear movement in the back of the small apartment. Additional units arrived on scene and we then conducted a protective sweep of the apartment as I could still hear movement inside. We announced our entry into the apartment but received no reply. We located a medium sized grey pit bull in the rear bedroom but no persons were located inside the apartment. While conducting the protective sweep, Officer Grimes observed additional marijuana in a clear baggie and a scale in plain view on the kitchen counter. We then froze the scene, while waiting to obtain a search warrant for the apartment. While I was chasing Mr. Douglas, Officer Fletcher had exited our patrol vehicle and noticed a female passenger in the front passenger seat getting out of the suspect vehicle. The female started to yell that she had nothing to do with the situation. Officer Fletcher then noticed in a bottle of promethazine in the middle console of the vehicle in plain view. The female passenger was later identified as Ms. Are'mesia Mahone, who then spoke with Officer Fletcher. Ms. Mahone stated that she had nothing to do with Mr. Douglas running on foot from Police. Ms. Mahone stated that Mr. Douglas had just picked her up on Donald Lee Hollowell Pkwy NW. and she said that he had to run an errand in the "Bluff". Ms. Mahone then stated that they were being pulled over by police and he jumped out of the vehicle and ran on foot. Ms. Mahone stated that she did not know his name and only had his phone number. Ms. Mahone described him as a male with long black dreads and that he was wearing a dark beanie cap. Ms. Mahone agreed to come to the Atlanta Police Headquarters a

He stated that he was hanging out in the area of McDaniel st. however he was unable to inform us of what time he was in that area. He stated the then parked on McDaniel st. and quickly went inside the corner store "speak easy". He stated that after a brief moment he returned to his vehicle and observed it being driven away. He stated that he did not know who took it. He then informed me that he had a female companion inside the vehicle that he met earlier on this day whom he only knows as "Keisha". He stated that he then went to his 'baby mother" apartment at 540 Humphries dr and contacted the police and informed them that his vehicle had just been stolen.I then asked him where his cell phone is, he stated his cell phone is at his 'baby mother' house at this time. I then asked him had he encountered any police officers today while driving his vehicle. Derrick then gave a brief pause and stated "yes I think so". He stated that he was driving in the area of north side dr enroute to visit his uncle 'Nigg" whom lives at the apartments located on North Ave. He stated that he drove down the entrance driveway of the complex and then parked and exited the vehicle. He stated that after exiting the vehicle he began to walk to the front apartment. He then stated that he observed multiple people running therefore he began to run as well. He informed us that he did not know why everyone was running; He stated that he is not sure what the female did whom was in the vehicle with him.At this time, I asked him did his vehicle really get stolen from McDaniel st. he responded "no". I informed him that he was observed by officers exiting the vehicle and immediately fleeing on foot after a traffic stop was initiated. He continued to state that he only ran because others in the area began to run. He was informed that we recovered his items such as cell phone and Identification from the vehicle. Derrick then again admitted that he did flee from the area; however it was only because everyone else was running.Female passenger Are'mesia Mahone 03/03/1991 provided us with a written statement of the incident. She also positively identified Derrick as the drive based upon a driver license photo. These statement forms were turned into police property as evidence.

Upon my arrival, I made contact with the arrestee (Mildred Oliv Lovelace, B/F, 01/03/1956, 1990 North Ave NW) I advised Ms. Lovelace the reason why I was at the location, and asked her if everybody was ok at the location. Ms. Lovelace stated yes everybody was, and that no one got stabbed. Due to the type of call I asked Ms. Lovelace if I can check the location for the victim myself, which she allowed me too. While attempting to locate the victim, I made contact with (Hughie Dillipree, B/M, 07/15/1963, 1990 North Ave NW) Mr. Dillipree was wearing shorts so I was able to notice on his right leg what appeared to be dried up blood. I then asked Mr. Dillipree to show me his leg, he showed me his left, and I then said no your right leg. I was able to locate the injury to his right knee, and realized he was the victim. I asked Mr. Dillipree what happened to him, and other series of question but he refused to tell me he was acting very uncooperative with me. Also with Grady (Unit 354) who arrived on scene, and refused any medical attention. After, further questioning Mr. Dillipree stated he was cut by a male but he did not know any information of the male, and he declined to press charges. I asked Mr. Dillipree for his name, date of birth, and ran his information on my mobile data terminal. It came back showing that Mr. Dillipree had a active warrant for his arrest issued by Fulton County S.O. for probation violence. Mr. Dillipree was then detained till the warrant was verified to still be active. ACIC advised me it was still active, Mr. Dillipree was then in custody at this point. Once I advised Mr. Dillipree that he was in custody because the warrant was active, he stated to me "well if I'm going to jail, I want her locked up too" Mr. Dillipree was referring to Ms. Lovelace. Mr. Dillipree then stated to me that Ms. Lovelace was the one that caused the injuries to him, that she poked him by mistake with a pencil during an argument they were having. I was unable to locate the pencil inside the location. I asked Mr. Dillipree what Ms. Lovelace was to him, he advised she was his girlfriend, and that they have a 16 year old son together, who was not at the location. I then checked our system's for pervious incidents of domestic violence between both parties, and I was able to locate multiple. I then placed Ms. Lovelace in custody. Crime Scene Investigator Reeves (Unit 7321) arrived on scene to take photo's of the inside of the house were blood was located, and photo's of Mr. Dillipree injuries but he refused to allow her. There were no witnesses on scene. Mr. Dillipree was later transported to Atlanta Grady Detention Center by Ofc. Balserio (Unit 1102) for his injuries. I later then transported Ms. Lovelace to Fulton County Jail. Mr. Dillipree was charged with one count of a Warrant Arrest. Ms. Lovelace was charged with one count of Domestic Violence Battery. No injuries due to arrest were advised on scene. Sgt. Bandy, and General Investigator McManis was advised of the incident. Nothing further to report at this time.

The victim was already at Grady Memorial Hospital when the call to police was made to 911.Upon my arrival, I met with the victim, Willie Woods, who stated that he was sexually assaulted. Mr. Woods could not be anymore specific than North Ave/Spring St  "near Georgia Tech," and became very agitated as I attempted to gain more specific details about the incident location. Mr. Woods stated that he was "at the gas station on North Ave", which we identified to be the BP gas station(610 Spring St NW) to get a beer, with the intention to leave there and go sit in Centennial Olympic Park to sit, drink, and watch the sun come up. Mr. Woods stated that he then walked "toward Centennial Park". As he described further ("Varsity on the right"), we (Georgia Tech PD responded as well)concluded that Mr. Woods left the station and travelled west on North Ave toward Centennial Olympic Park Dr. He stated he always looks down everywhere he walks and could not say if he crossed over the interstate on North Ave or not. He stated that before he got to Centennial Olympic Park Dr, he saw three males (two white males, one black male) off the side of the sidewalk smoking cigarettes. He claimed that he asked if he could have one and that one responded, "Come get it." He then stated that once he walked up to them, one of the white males put him in a chokehold, and the other white male pointed a gun (described as a "Glock 9mm", because he "knows guns") at this head, as the black male proceeded to yank his pants down and penetrate him anally/sodomize him.

He stated that he may have been in the park about 45 minutes, before he then walked to Grady Memorial Hospital for medical attention.   Mr. Woods stated that he would not be able to identify the males again. The best he could say was that the males were probably in their mid-20's. He also stated that the male with the gun was wearing "nice, expensive sneakers". Mr. Woods stated he also could not say what time the incident happened, because he has no concept of day/date/ time due to his pre-existing medical conditions (Bipolar Disorder, Paranoid Schizophrenia). Mr. Woods stated that he takes medication for his conditions, but has not taken them in about a week. The best time he could say when the assault occurred was when it was still dark outside. Mr. Woods also stated that he was drunk at the time the incident occurred, having spent the day "drinking in Piedmont Park". He claimed to have drank 8-9 24 oz. beers and a couple "dollar shots of Jack Daniels" before he walked to the BP gas station to get another beer.   Georgia Tech has cameras in the area where the assault was believed to have occurred.

163460559	4	On 12/11/16, at around 4:33am, I was dispatched to 460 North ave in regards to a car accident with injuries. When I arrived on scene a Grady bus had already arrived and were assisting the occupants of a white Toyota(RET4733) when one of the grady personnel approached me and stated that, per the occupants, the vehicle that struck the Toyota was a champagne colored Cadillac that drove north on Boulevard. All the occupants were inside the vehicle when I arrived on scene when Ms. BROWN complained of chest pains, Mr. TRUESDALE complained of leg and a headache while Ms. HATCHER complained of a headache.I spoke to Ms. BROWN who stated that, she was in the far left lane(westbound) of North Ave and was trying to make a left turn to enter a parking lot when a vehicle that was traveling in the opposite direction struck her vehicle and spun it around. She stated that, the vehicle drove to the Citgo and stopped when she made contact with the driver and got the tag of the vehicle. She would go on to state the black female driver of the hit and run vehicle seemed intoxicated and that it had heavy damage on the front of the vehicle. I requested a tow truck since the Toyota was blocking the street and there were lots of debris(vehicle parts) where the accident had occurred. The Grady ambulance transported all the occupants of the Toyota to the Atlanta Medical Center when a Buick approached us and the driver, Mr. COX, stated that he was near 654 Boulevard NE and was exiting a parking lot on the west side of Boulevard on to the southern lanes of Boulevard NE when a champagne colored Nissan came in to his lane of traffic, struck the area around his rear driver side wheel and drove off. He stated that, he believes the vehicle that struck his vehicle was the same as the vehicle that struck the Toyota.A few minutes later a call was dispatched to 1603(Ofc. WADE) in regards to a vehicle that struck a utility pole at 395 Ponce de Leon Ave(couple of blocks north of the initial incident location). I advised radio that the incident maybe related to my car accidents since the occupants of the Toyota advised me that the vehicle was severely damaged for the vehicle to travel a large distance and that the driver was intoxicated.Ofc. WADE would go on to advise me that he located the vehicle and he would later state that the female driver was still at the location. During this time period the tow truck driver stated that the hit and run vehicle was a Nissan since the vehicle parts were of a Nissan when I asked him how he could possible know. I saw him walk to the debris field, pick up an item and then brought it to me. I noticed that the item had the Nissan logo written on it. I thought Mr. COX had advised me that he saw the black female driver when I asked him to relocate to 395 Ponce de leon ave with me. When we arrived on scene I noticed a vehicle that was partially in the parking lot of a business while the front section of the vehicle was outside the parking lot resting against a wire that was holding a utility pole located on the sidewalk.I spoke with Ofc. WADE and checked the tag of the vehicle. I then checked the call I had originally been dispatched to and noticed that the initial lookout given of the vehicle was PYZ2001 which was identical to the vehicle resting against the pole's wire. I spoke with the driver of the vehicle who was inside the ambulance when she stated that she was trying to park her vehicle when a guy was trying to help and was telling her to back-up. When I asked her if she had any alcoholic beverages to drink she stated no but when I asked her to explain why I could smell alcohol on her breath she stated that she had one beer. During our conversation I noticed slurred speech, confused, droopy face, and the smell of an alcoholic beverage on her breath, etc.I asked her about her injuries when she stated that she hurt her knee.

163450305	4	On December 10, 2016 at approximately 0157 hours, I Officer C. Wade (Unit #1603 Vehicle #33019) was flagged down in regards to a hit and run that occurred at the intersection of North Ave NE and Piedmont Ave NE. As I was driving westbound on North Ave approaching the Argonne Ave NE intersection, I witnessed a gray in color Dodge Ram with damage to the front right side travelling at a high rate of speed east on North Ave NE. The gray Dodge Ram was being followed closely by a dark color Saturn G25 who appeared to be following the vehicle. As I approached the intersection, the driver of the dark colored Saturn began flashing his high beam lights at my patrol vehicle. As I stopped, the driver of the Saturn pulled up beside my patrol car and advised me that the driver of the gray Dodge Ram that he was following had just sideswiped his vehicle and left the scene. At that time, I turned around and was going to initiate a traffic stop on the vehicle in an attempt to investigate the allege hit and run. Before I could catch up with the vehicle to initiate a traffic stop, the gray Dodge Ram made a right hand turn into the parking lot located at 355 North Ave NE. After turning into the parking lot located at 355 North Ave NE, the driver of the Dodge Ram proceeded to pull into a parking space and then reverse and turn his vehicle around. The driver of the vehicle continued to pull back and forth and a maneuver his vehicle around in the parking lot. At that time, I instructed the driver to turn his vehicle off and thrown his keys out the window. At first, the driver did not turn the vehicle off and kept his hands inside the vehicle. After giving several loud verbal commands to turn the vehicle off and throw the keys out of the window, the driver finally turned the car off and dropped the keys on the ground. I then approached the driver and instructed him to get out of the vehicle. While standing next to the vehicle, I smelled the odor of alcohol coming from inside. The driver was then removed from the vehicle and due to him being a possible flight risk, he was placed in handcuffs and taken to my patrol vehicle. When the driver of the Dodge Ram exited his vehicle, he immediately lost his balance and while walking towards my patrol vehicle, he was unable to walk with stumbling. I also noticed that the driver's eyes seemed glossy and watery. I then spoke with Mr. LEEPER, Jeremiah (DOB 7/10/1982) who was the driver of the dark colored Saturn G25 that was struck by the driver of the gray Dodge Ram. Mr. LEEPER stated that he and his girlfriend Ms. BENITEZ, Jennifer (DOB 11/25/1984) had just left from eating dinner and was driving eastbound on North Ave NE approaching the Piedmont Ave NE intersection when his vehicle was struck. Mr. LEEPER stated that while driving, the gray in color Dodge Ram that he was following sideswiped his vehicle and did not stop. Mr. LEEPER stated that the vehicle struck him and then proceeded to turn right and drive the wrong way on Piedmont Ave NE. Mr. LEEPER then stated he then dropped off his girlfriend and then left to go find the driver that struck his car. Mr. LEEPER stated that he was able to locate the gray Dodge Ram and began to follow it. Mr. LEEPER stated that he had followed the vehicle for a short time until he was able to flag down police. After speaking with Mr. LEEPER, I returned to my patrol car and was able to identify GREGORY, Timothy (DOB 1/16/1984) who was the driver of the gray Dodge Ram. While sitting in my patrol car, Mr. GREGORY began asking me if he struck Mr. LEEPER's vehicle. Mr. GREGORY also stated, without question, that he had not drank that much alcoholic beverage that night. Mr. GREGORY stated that his vehicle is a larger vehicle and if he was involved in an accident, he would not be able to feel it. After further investigating the incident, I read Mr. GREGORY Georgia Implied Consent and asked if he would submit to a test of his blood. Mr. GREGORY refused the blood tes
163450494	4	On the listed date and time I Officer D.Vickers responded to a Dispute call. Upon my arrival I met with Mr. Mathew Sledge. He was very intoxicated and had a hard time making logical statements. He stated that his girlfriend left the house for a few hours and during that time he was having physical relations with another lady. Furthermore, he advised his girlfriend returned home and found them both together. He continued to state that the mistress left the location and he was afraid he was going to get beat up by his current girlfriend so he called 911. While I was at the location there was no signs that any arguing of fighting had occurred. Mr. Sledge thoughts were all over the place. I advised him that he was intoxicated and that it was best for him to sleep it off. I also ordered him not to call 911 unless it was a actual need for law enforcement. He was somewhat argumentative, but agreed and stated he was going to bed. At that time I left the location. Shortly after while I was on another call, radio dispatched another officer back to Mr. Sledge's house for the same type of call. Once again Mr. Sledge needlessly called 911. The officer once again advised Mr. Sledge to go to sleep. Not long after I got called back to the location. I spoke to him for the third time. I advised him that he could not keep calling 911 without a good cause. He was still highly intoxicated and was rambling on making incoherent statements regarding who pays the bills and what not, none of which had anything to do with any crime or need for law enforcement. He made it clear that there was a good chance he was going to continue on with abusing 911 system and obstructing me from handling more important and legit calls. He was taken into custody and charged for Disorderly Conduct and transported to City Detention.

162431983	4	On 08/30/2016 I (Ofc. Hansen) responded to 525 Glen Iris Drive NE on a simple auto theft. Upon arrival I spoke with the victim Ms. Kari Hurt, who stated that she parked the listed 2008 Toyota Camry, GA tag AVT4011, on the fourth level of the parking deck Sunday night around 11:30 PM, left the vehicle unlocked after retrieving some belongings from the vehicle, and then returned today to find that the vehicle had been stolen.While on scene, Ms. Hurt and I were able to speak with Ms. Sandy Becker of the AMLI Old 4th Ward Apartments Leasing Office, who advised that the cameras in the parking deck had captured the incident. Ms Becker showed me the footage, which around 11:40 PM shows a light-skinned black male with a low hair cut wearing black pants and a black shirt in the parking deck near Ms. Hurt's vehicle. The footage shows the male, who stands about 5'10" and appears to be in his mid 20s, enter into Ms. Hurt's vehicle, which appeared to be unlocked, and then drive off. The vehicle then reappears in another camera view, which shows the vehicle stop, at which point the male exits the vehicle and appears to enter into a white crossover vehicle or SUV in the parking deck around 11:56 PM. This vehicle may be connected to Atlanta Police Case Number 162420587, but the video provided by Ms. Becker is not clear on this white vehicle. The male then relocated Ms. Hurt's vehicle to a handicapped parking space on level three of the parking deck, at which point the male enters into an unlocked gray 2010 Toyota Corolla with a Mississippi license plate of LXW210. No report has been generated in regards to this vehicle, which is not listed as stolen. The male then exits the camera from shortly before midnight in Ms. Hurt's vehicle.Ms. Becker's email is sbecker@amli.com, and her phone number is 404-523-4484.

162431983	4	On September 4, 2016, I, Officer T. Cosby responded to 525 Glen Iris Dr NE on reports of a recovered auto. Upon arrival I spoke with the Victim, Ms. Kari Hurt, who stated that she saw her gray Toyota Camry pull inside the parking deck at the location. The vehicle was reported stolen to the Atlanta Police Department on August 30, 2016 and I confirmed the vehicle was on the system as stolen. Ms. Hurt gave me the keys to her vehicle to allow me to look for the vehicle inside the gated parking deck. As I searched the deck for her vehicle, I observed a gray Toyota Camry driving down the parking garage towards the exit. I had my patrol SUV in the middle of the drive which did not allow enough space for the driver to pass my vehicle. As I exited the vehicle and started to approach the vehicle, the vehicle back up the driveway and made a u-turn. I returned to the patrol vehicle and activated my Police blue lights and siren. The vehicle did not stop and drove at a high rate of speed back up the parking garage. Due to the tight spaces of the garage and my patrol SUV I was unable to maintain sight of the vehicle. The vehicle speed past multiple bystanders at a high rate of speed. I requested other officer to the location to help with the search for the vehicle, however, we were not able to locate the vehicle. In interaction was captured on the patrol vehicles dashcamera 33172.

Ms. HURT informed the officer that she parked her car, a gray 2008 Toyota Camry, Georgia AVT4011, inside the secured parking deck late evening on 08/28/2016 and discovered it to be missing on 08/30.I met with apartment community manager, Sandy BECKER, and she provided me with video footage of the crime. The video shows that on 08/28/2016 at 2308 hours, a gray Toyota Corolla pulls into the unsecured portion of the parking deck and parks. The driver exits the car, looks around and then maneuvers the car closer to the vehicle entry/exit gate. There is no footage showing how the Corolla made entry into the secured portion of the parking deck but at 2316 hours, I can see the driver walking away from a parked vehicle (owner unknown) and then re-enter the Corolla. There are two additional videos which show the driver going car to car attempting to make entry. At one point, the driver can be seen entering a Toyota Camry, Kari HURT being the lawful owner, and then driving away with said Camry.The gray Corolla left behind by the suspect, bearing Mississippi LXW210, had been reported stolen to Atlanta Police on 08/29/2016. This incident was documented using Case # 162420778 and the theft would've occurred sometime on 08/28/2016 before 2308 hours.A screenshot of the suspect was captured and distributed throughout the police department via e-mail. I received information from Inv Churchill that he knew the person in the photograph to be Tony HILLSMAN. I looked up HILLSMAN's photograph and agree that it is in fact Tony HILLSMAN that is on video committing the crime mentioned above.I ran a check on HILLSMAN and discovered an active warrant for his arrest due to HILLSMAN battering his girlfriend. HILLSMAN was arrested for this offense and made a court appearance during the week of November 1st. Inv Churchill attended that court appearance and spoke with the victim of said battery, Candace CARTER. The photograph of the suspected car thief was shown to CARTER by Inv CHURCHILL and CARTER identified the person in the picture as HILLSMAN.On 11/06/2016, I secured arrest warrants from Magistrate Court of Fulton County for that of Tony HILLSMAN for the offense of Burglary 2nd (entering a secured structure in order to commit a theft) and Theft x Taking Motor Vehicle.HILLSMAN is currently in custody of Fulton Sheriff for an unrelated incident...
162431983	4	On 10/31/2016 I Inv. Churchill viewed an email from Zone 6 Inv. Gurley that captured a photo of a black male suspect dressed in black pants and a black shirt walking toward a gray color vehicle which was reported stolen from 525 Glen Iris NE on 08/30/2016 case #162431983. There was also video attached to the email that captured the same male entering the parking deck driving a different gray color vehicle which was later discovered to be stolen from 116 Ponce De Leon on 08/29/2016 case #162420778. The suspect can be seen in the video exiting the first vehicle and entering and leaving in the second vehicle.  After watching the video, I recognized the male to be Tony Hillsman DOB: 04/12/1992 from past cases that I've worked in Zone 5. I spoke with Inv. Cosby who advised that he was scheduled for court on 11/01/2016 for a case that involved Hillsman and his ex-girlfriend Candace Carter DOB: 12/09/1993 (Simple Battery- DV).  I went to court with Inv. Crosby for the probable cause hearing and had a chance to speak with the victim/ baby's mother Ms. Candace Carter. I showed Ms. Carter a still photo of the suspect walking to the stolen gray vehicle from case #162431983. Ms. Carter looked at the photo and said " that's TJ". I asked Ms. Carter who was TJ and she said "Tony Hillsman we call him TJ". Her grandmother Linda Hardy also identified Hillsman as the person in the picture. Ms. Carter provided contact information to be reached for further investigation. I called both Inv. Gurley and Inv. Barnett and provided them with this information.

I approached Mr. Mitchell, and noticed that his eyes were blood shot red and watery, and I could smell an odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I asked Mr. Mitchell what happened and he stated that he was coming from his friends house, around the corner, and while he was driving, his phone fell on the floor.

I asked Mr. Mitchell if he was injured, and he stated that he was not. I asked Mr. Mitchell to step out of the vehicle, and brought him to the front of my patrol car. I continued to smell an odor of Alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. I asked Mr. Mitchell how much he had to drink tonight, and he stated that throughout the night he had 3 drinks containing 8% alcohol. I asked him where he was at tonight and he stated he was coming from his friends house.

I informed him that for this test he needed to listen to my instructions, and not to start until I told him to. I started to give him the instructions, when Mr. Mitchell informed me that he didnt think he should be doing these tests, because he was still shaken up by the accident, and felt that would affect his performance.

The information came back however I did not believe that was the driver. I asked the driver how old she was and she stated 41 but a few minutes later she stated she was 44. I told the driver that she would have to be 43 years old if she was born on the date she gave. The driver also looked significantly younger than 40. The driver was detained.

I went back over to the driver and asked her who the car belonged to. She stated it belonged to her step father Mr.Terrill Lee. I asked the driver if she could call her mother. The driver gave me permission to use her phone to call her mom. I asked the driver for her mother's name and she stated it was Ms. Lee. I asked her for her mother's first name and she stated it was Pharonda. I asked her if her and her mother had the same name since she had stated earlier it was her name. The driver got upset again and said she was already going to jail and we were already going to finger print her so it didnt matter. The driver's mother did not answer

163153087	4	On November 10, 2016 at approximately 8:30 p.m., I, Officer Drinkard, along with partner, Officer P. White, were on a directed patrol in the area of North Avenue near Griffin Street. While in the area we observed a light colored Mercury Marquis, bearing Georgia License Plate #PTG7316, make a left turn without signaling (with vehicles present) onto Griffin Street. As we passed by the suspect vehicle, it was also readily apparent that the windshield was cracked in a spiderweb pattern across the entire windshield of the vehicle obstructing the vision of the operator. At this point we turned around and prepared to position ourselves to effect a traffic stop on the suspected vehicle.          We advised radio of our location, description of the vehicle and possible occupants and license plate. As we turned around the suspect vehicle quickly pulled into an abandoned lot and retraced the same exact route from which it was previously spotted. As the vehicle pulled back up to 710 North Avenue NW, is when we activated all emergency equipment (audible and visual equipment including spotlight) to affect a traffic stop. At that point, I approached the driver and advised who we were and as to the reason for the stop. I asked the driver for his driver's license, which he provided.           Officer White checked the vehicle and the driver on our MDT (Mobile Data Terminal) on ACIC (Atlanta Crime Information Center) via GCIC (Georgia Crime Information Center) and verified there was a possible warrant for the driver. At that point, I advised the driver, Mr. Zachariah D. Williams, to step out of the vehicle and he was detained pending confirmation of the warrant. ACIC shortly thereafter confirmed the warrant and Mr. Williams was placed into custody (handcuffs double locked and adjusted for fit) searched and placed in the rear of our patrol vehicle. Mr. Williams and his passenger and unknown male advised they were considered to be sovereign citizens as they were members of a Masonic and Shriner's Lodge. They stated they reserved the right to refuse the stop and subsequent search but understood we were doing our job. Mr. Williams property was logged into the City of Atlanta Property as property. Mr. Williams was transported to the City of Atlanta Detention Center without incident. There is nothing further at this time. ***END OF REPORT***

After approaching the vehicle the driver, Mr. Lametrius Harmon, smelled of an alcoholic beverage and was slurring his speak. I then proceeded to the location to verify if Mr. Harmon was safe to drive a motor vehicle. I arrived on scene with OFC Shields and OFC Shelley and made sure my patrol car camera was recording and that I had my microphone on. I approached the vehicle and introduced myself to Mr. Harmon. I explained to Mr. harmon that I was there to verify if he was safe to drive a motor vehicle and because he was swerving in and out of his lane of travel. I asked Mr. Harmon where he was coming from and Mr. Harmon stated "My cousin's house". I asked Mr. Harmon where his cousin lived and Mr. Harmon replied  "I don't know". I asked Mr. Harmon why he did not know since he was just there and Mr.Harmon stated "1410" I asked "1410 what?" and Mr. Harmon replied "1410. I don't know the street. There are too many streets in Atlanta and I'm from Riverdale". I asked Mr. Harmon if he had any alcoholic beverages while at his cousin's house and Mr. Harmon stated that he had not, but was hesitant in his response. I asked Mr. Harmon again and he hesitated and said "no". I asked Mr. Harmon why he was so hesitant in his responses and Mr. Harmon replied "It's 2016 and you're the police". While talking to Mr Harmon I could smell the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from him and the vehicle, Mr. Harmon was slurring his speech and had glassy, red eyes that could not focus on me.I asked Mr. Harmon to step out of the vehicle so that I could check to see if he was safe to operate a motor vehicle. I asked Mr. harmon if he would conduct field sobriety testing and Mr. Harmon agreed. I explained to Mr. Harmon that I would demonstrate each test and then have him preform it and if he had any questions he could ask at anytime. Before conducting the testing I went over Mr. Harmon's answers from previous questions and asked again where he was coming from and Mr. Harmon stated "his friend's cousin's house". I asked why he said it was his cousin and Mr. Harmon stated that it "was his friend's cousin's". I informed Mr. Harmon that I could smell alcohol on his breathe and asked again if he had been drinking and Mr Harmon replied "I had a couple a few hours ago". I asked what a couple drinks were and Mr. Harmon stated "two". I asked what percentage of alcohol the drinks were and he stated "I don't know the percentage. They were Bud Ice". While speaking with Mr. Harmon he was swaying back and forth heavily and his eyes continued to get heavy like they wanted to close. I then demonstrated the heel to toe walk for Mr. Harmon and asked if he understood which he stated he did. During the heel to toe walk, Mr. Harmon stumbled several time, did not touch his heel to his toe, and walked off the straight line several times. I then preformed the one legged stand for Mr. Harmon. After demonstrating the one legged stand, Mr. Harmon took the test and failed to stand on one leg for 10 seconds and would speed up counting to get the test over with quicker and avoid putting his leg down, which he did twice. After performing field sobriety, I read Mr. Harmon Georgia Implied Consent Law for the chemical breathe test. Mr. Harmon asked if I was asking if he would take a breathylizer and I told him yes and Mr. Harmon stated "no" refusing Georgia Implied Consent Law.I informe

163090001	4	On November 4, 2016 I, (Officer C.S. Thornton) cited Mr. Joey M. Jones for being in a public park after hours at 1139 North Ave NW.While in route to the City of Atlanta fuel pumps, I noticed a silver Dodge pickup truck (Year: 2013 Tag:QAY6437) parked, with the engine running and head lights on; in a gravel area within Maddox Park. Once I directed my spotlight on the vehicle I witnessed Mr. Jones in the drivers seat slouched over with his eyes closed. Once I approached the driver side door of the pickup truck, I knocked on the window to wake Mr. Jones numerous times. Once Mr. Jones opened his eyes, I asked him to roll down his window. Mr. Jones then began to press on his steering wheel. After repeatedly asking Mr. Jones to roll his window down so I could speak to him, he finally did and stated he was trying to roll his window down. When I asked him how was he trying to roll his window down, Mr. Jones pressed on his steering wheel again. I asked Mr. Jones where he was traveling to, why was he asleep in the park with his vehicle running, and where had he come from. Mr. Jones responses were incoherent and he was not able to answer my questions. I then asked Mr. Jones to turn the vehicle off and hand me the keys until I could determine his sobriety. I asked Mr. Jones for his drivers license and at that time I noticed Mr. Jones had an conceal carry license in his wallet. I asked Mr. Jones if there were any weapons in the vehicle and he advised he did have a gun inside. I then asked Mr. Jones to step out of the vehicle while I conduct my investigation. While Mr. Jones was out of the vehicle I asked what is his highest level of education and he advised that he graduated highschool. I then asked Mr. Jones multiple times to say his ABC's and he was not able to. As Mr. Jones recited his alphabet I could smell the strong scent of alcoholic beverage on his breath. When inquired of his previous consumption of alcoholic Mr. Jones advised he had (6) six Coronas. Mr. Jones was given an option to a field sobriety test, but he could not comprehend the reasoning. Based off my investigation and observation I determined Mr. Jones was also too intoxicated to leave the property in his motor vehicle safely. Without incident I detained Mr. Jones and placed him in the back of my patrol car. While awaiting a wrecker to impound the vehicle Mr. Jones' wife Ms. Melaine Jones arrived at the location by tracking his cell phone. Mr. Jones' vehicle was released to his wife Ms. Jones. Mr. Jones was cited for being in the park after hours (City Ordinance: 110-60). Mr. Jones was given a copy of charges and allowed to go with his wife. Supervisor unit# 1195 (Sgt. R.

Jackson were viewing the video intergration camera at the intersection of North Ave and Boulvevard NE when we observed a black male smoking what appeared to be a marijuana cigarette in front of the coin laundry at 455 North Ave. NE. The male, later identified as Darius SMITH was observed smoking a cigarette in one hand, holding it between his fingers, and interchangeably smoking the marijuana in his other hand. SMITH would clinch his hand into a fist whenever taking a break from the marijuana cigarette, instead of holding it openly like the tobacco product in his other hand. Upon our approach, the marijuana cigarette was dropped to the ground. I located and picked the contraband up as it sat next to SMITH. SMITH was run on ACIC and came back with a probation violation warrant for robbery (WNO#11SC105744) out of Fulton County. SMITH was charged with possession of marijuana less than an ounce, 16-13-2b and transported to city jail for the warrant. The recovered narcotics were logged into property as evidence.

162632943	4	On September 20, 2016 at approximately 8:20pm I, Ofc. Autry, responded to an abandoned stolen vehicle at 1964 North AVE NW. The anonymous caller had advised that three young black males exited the vehicle and went toward a shortcut that lead to Detroit AVE NW. Myself and several units canvassed the area, but were unable to locate any suspects. Upon checking the area of 1964 North AVE NW the white in color 2007 Dodge Charger (Tennessee Tag# H0244D) was found to be abandoned with the doors unlocked. I dusted the vehicle for latent prints and converted my findings in as evidence. The vehicle was confirmed to have been stolen out of the city of Atlanta on September 19, 2016 from 74 Northside DR NW. When I inventoried the vehicle I discovered a blue in color cellphone. Upon checking to see if the phone belonged to the owner of the vehicle I found that it had a security lock and could not be opened, but the background photograph was of a black male (possibly Dontavious Smith) standing on a red in color vehicle. The phone was also converted to evidence to be held at the property annex. S&W Towing impounded the vehicle to be held for the owner. The vehicle was removed from the system as stolen. Lt.

I informed the driver to return to his vehicle.I approached the driver side window to speak with the driver, Mr. Tony COATES. When speaking to him I could smell a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath, I also noticed that his eyes were bloodshot and watery. I asked Mr. Coates where he was coming from and he stated to me that he was coming from "Atlanta". I informed him that Atlanta is a large city, and that I wanted to know exactly where he was coming from. Mr. Coates continued to tell me that he was coming from Atlanta, but after asking him a few more times, he admitted he was coming from a friends house. I asked Mr. Coates  how much he had to drink tonight, and he stated that he wasn't sure, but then stated he had around 2 or 3 beers.I asked Mr. Coates to step out of his vehicle, and asked him to come to the front of my vehicle.

No, Are you wearing contacts? No, Do you have any physical disabilities? No, but I do have PTSD. While asking Mr. Coates these questions, I continued to smell a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath.

I did not observe Vertical gaze Nystagmus.Next I informed Mr. Coates that he would be doing the Walk and Turn. I informed him to listen to my instructions, and not to start until I told him to. I informed him to imagine a straight line from where he was standing to the front of my patrol car. I informed him to place his left foot on the line, and his right foot heel to toe in front of his left. Mr. Coates at this time placed his RIGHT foot on the line instead on his left. I informed him to make sure it was his left. Mr. Coates then followed my instructions, however had a tough time getting his feet straight on the line. After Mr. Coates placed his feet on the line correctly, I informed him that when I told him to start he would take 9 heel to toe steps on the line, pivot around on his pivot foot and take 9 heel to toe steps back on the line. I demonstrated this part of the test by taking 3 heel to toe steps on a straight line, showing him how to correctly pivot, and taking 3 heel to toe steps back on the line. I informed him that during the test to make sure he kept his hands down by his side, keep his head down looking at his feet, count each step out loud, and not to stop until the test was over. I asked Mr. Coates if he understood my instructions, and he stated that he did.Mr. Coates began the test.

162492473	4	On September 5th, 2016 I (Ofc. C.S. Thornton) conducted the arrest of an intoxicated driver in the area of 899 North Ave NW. During the course of patrol I observed a vehicle (1995 - Nissan / 200 SX: GA# RAP4897) exiting south on Joseph E. Lowery Blvd NW from out the parking lot of 918 Donald Lee Hollowell Pkwy NW (Citi Package Beer & Wine Store) without any lights active at night. I activated my emergency equipment in order to effect a traffic stop. However, the vehicle continued to travel south on Joseph E. Lowery Blvd NW until turning east on North Ave NW where the vehicle came to a complete stop. Unsure of the nature of the occupants they were order to show their hands out the vehicle. The passenger (Mr. Antwoin Anderson) cooperated immediately with my verbal order, but the driver (Mr. Derrick Sawyer) displayed difficultly following instructions. Making face to face contact with the occupants I could immediately smell the strong stench of alcoholic beverage coming from within the vehicle. As I advised Mr. Sawyer the reason for stopping him; he still displayed difficulty trying to obtain his wallet, and turning off the vehicle upon request. After receiving Mr. Sawyer's Georgia drivers license I could clearly observe both occupants were highly under the influence of alcoholic beverages by their physical manifestations (glassy eyes, talking excessively, and sloppy behavior). In addition, before I could ask Mr. Sawyer out the vehicle (he) flatulated, which he could not control his bodily functions.As I asked Mr. Sawyer out the vehicle he clearly swayed and staggered out the vehicle to the directed position behind his vehicle. I casually asked Mr. Sawyer to recite his alphabet from "A" to "Z" which he repeated "E,F,D" and later pronounced the letter "P" as "Peel". I stopped Mr. Sawyer asking him to try to recite his alphabet again from "A" to "Z" which after the letter "T" Mr. Sawyer advised "I don't know" and gave up. I asked Mr. Sawyer if he has been drinking prior to driving which he stated to have (2) two beers of Busch 16oz (2) two hours prior to driving. Finally, I asked Mr. Sawyer for consent to check his eyes for horizontal gaze nystagmus which was given. Without incident Mr. Sawyer could not follow my stimulus (finger) to observe any form of nystagmus; as I smelled the heavy scent of alcoholic beverage from his breath. Based on my knowledge, training, and experience I felt no further testing to determine Mr. Sawyer was under the influence of alcohol. Mr. Sawyer was physically detained, searched, and secured inside my patrol vehicle to investigate and advise Mr. Anderson. By this time Mr. Anderson had attracted other members (associates, friends) of the area who observed the traffic stop. Mr. Anderson had these members contact a Mr. Rodrick Taylor to come on scene in order to retrieve Mr. Sawyer's vehicle with his consent. In addition, Mr. Sawyer gave Mr. Anderson consent to retrieve his personal belongings to include his cigarettes and mobile phones for safe keeping. Next, Mr. Sawyer was transported to the Zone 1 Precinct in order to read his Georgia Implied Consent. On arrival to the Zone 1 Precinct Mr. Sawyer was read his Georgia Implied Consent in an even tone and speed of speech. Upon the completion of the Georgia Implied Consent requesting a breath test (he) would not answer with a "Yes" or "No", but advised he was just trying to have a good time.  At least (3) three times I asked Mr. Sawyer for a "Yes" or "No" answer, but he continued to advised he was just trying to have a good time; which I accepted as a refusal.During his detainment at the Zone 1 Precinct Mr. Sawyer was adamant to use the bathroom; which he used extensively. Next, as I completed his Georgia Implied Consent form and citations Mr. Sawyer fell fast into a slumber. Mr. Sawyer's slumber was deep to the point his eyes could be seen rolling to the back of his head as his eyes lids laid partially opened. After the completion of Mr. Sawy

Rita had been badly beaten and was unable to speak to me. However, Unit 1103 had responded before I did and stated the victim told him she had been raped. I spoke to the Grady Units and they also said she advised she was raped. At that time I raised Sex Crimes Unit Investigator Buckles and advised him of the incident. Grady transported Rita to Grady Hospital. Unit 1103 also responded to Grady and met with Inv. Buckles. I stayed at the incident location and waited for Crimes Scene Investigators to respond and take pictures. While Inv.

She stated that her and a few other people were in the rooming house drinking and hanging out. Furthermore, she stated at some point she was alone in her bedroom with a young male. She continued to state at that time the male choked her and punched her in the face with his closed fist. He then went into her bedroom closet and took $170.00 from her purse and left the location. I spoke to a roommate Dexter Hughson, he advised that he heard Rita yelling and had to kick in her door in order to get in and help her but the suspect was already gone. After he saw her injuries the call to 911 was made. The incident took place in a rooming house with lots of people coming and going. As the word of the incident and the description of the suspect got out, people started to mention the name Montavious Stokley. I spoke to Vonetta Stokley and she stated that her son was in the house earlier. But wasn't sure if he would do any such crime. I was unable to make contact with Montavious at that time. As time went on Vonetta walked back to my location with her son Montavious.

This area is known for open drug sales and the crimes associated with narcotics sales, robberies, assaults, thefts and prostitution.  On this date I spotted a car in the rear of the Pizza Hut parking lot, running with the lights off, near the dumpster.  The Pizza Hut is closed at this time and has been closed for hours.  The parking lot is not lit at this hour. We activated our blue lights and approached the car.  There were two occupants.  There was a white female driver. The passenger was a black male.  I know the passenger from the area.  He frequents the area and is known to me to be involved in drug activity.  They were both acting nervous.  The male was also under the influence of alcohol.  I asked the driver if she knew the passenger.  She said yes but was acting pecular, and did not know his name.  I know the male to be Antonio Williams.  I have arrested him twice in this same area in the last 18 months for drug related offences.  I asked her to step out of the vehicle.  I was attempting to talk with her away from Mr Williams, to make sure she is OK.  She acted like she was getting out and did a quick hand to hand with Mr. Williams.  She passed him a small item.  He had his hand cupped.  The female, Lisa Marie Tagliapietra, stepped out of the car and stepped towards the rear of the car with Officer Bursby.  I asked Mr. Williams what is in his hand.  He said nothing and started grinding his hand to destroy the item.  He opened his hand in a downward motion and I observed what appeared to be1 hit of crack and crumbs from the attempted destruction.  The suspected crack cocaine fell onto the center consul and I recovered it.  The piece was seized and tested, using a chemical field test kit supplied by City of Atalnta Police.  (The substance tested positive for cocaine with a chemical cocaine test kit when we left the scene).  I read both of the persons their Miranda rights. They did agree to talk to me without lawyer.  Lisa Marie Tagliapietra said that she picked up the male(Mr. Williams) on Ponce De Leon.  They drove to this location to buy crack.  She said that she has been to rehab but started relapsing.  She has been using cocaine again for the last month and a half. She denied giving Mr. Williams the crack.  She said that she was out of money.  Mr Williams said that he did not have the crack either.  I told him that I watched him drop it.  He refused to comment.  I placed him under arrest for Possession Of Cocaine 16-13-30(ac).  The female, Lisa Marie Tagliapietra, was charged with Prohibited Acts In A Commercial Drug Free Zone 106-405.  This particular area is designated a Commercial Drug Free Zone by City of Atlanta.  Ms Tagliapietra was transported to Pretrial Detention Center.  Mr Williams was transported to Fulton County Jail.  I obtained a warrant for his arrest for Possession of Cocaine EW-0179657.  The cocaine was turned in to property as evidence.  The car, a black Chevy Cobalt, was impounded by Buckhead wrecker service.

162122610	4	On July 30, 2016, I, OFC A Conley, was dispatched to an accident on Interstate 75/85 Southbound and North Avenue. While in route to the call, I was traveling on the on ramp from Northside Drive and Interstate 75 Southbound behind an SUV. While slowing down for merging traffic, a black Chevrolet Malibu passed me on the left hand side driving along the shoulder almost sideswiping my patrol car and the SUV in front of me. The Malibu was driving at an undetermined high rate of speed and then changed lanes erraticly into the travel lane. While cars were trying to merge onto the interstate the Malibu changed lanes and began driving south through the gore and then rapidly changed lanes overtaking merging traffic and began weaving in and out of traffic. I began to speed up and got behind the Malibu. As I was getting behind the Malibu, the Malibu began swerving in and out of the lane it was traveling in and I then initiated a traffic stop with full lights and sirens in a marked City of Atlanta patrol car. After pulling the vehicle over on the interstate at North Avenue, I approached and introduce myself to the driver, Ms. Adria'ana Johnson. I informed Ms. Johnson that I pulled her over due to her erratic and aggressive driving and for almost hitting my vehicle and the vehicle in front of me. Ms. Johnson apologized and stated that she was heading home. I asked Ms. Johnson where she was coming from and she stated "Top Golf". I asked Ms. Johnson what she had to drink and she stated "I was there for a work function. The bought a lot of Patron and I drank two shots." While talking to Ms. Johnson I could smell alcohol on her breathe and she was slurring her words slightly. I then asked Ms. Johnson to step out of the vehicle and walked her back to my patrol car. I informed Ms. Johnson that I was going to conduct field sobriety testing to make sure she was safe to drive a vehicle due to smelling alcohol and the amount of traffic violations that had been committed. Ms. Johnson agreed. I explained and demonstrated the heel to toe test to Ms. Johnson and then asked if Ms. Johnson understood. Ms. Johnson stated that she did and then began the test. During the test, Ms. Johnson failed to stay in a straight line even though she was trying to follow the one painted on the ground and failed to touch heel to toe. Ms. Johnson also asked me how many steps she had completed and lost her balance. I then preformed the one leg stand and explained the test to Ms. Johnson. Ms. Johnson stated she understood and then began. During the test Ms. Johnson failed to keep her hands at her side and continuously swayed. After field sobriety testing was complete, I felt as Ms. Johnson was not safe to drive a motor vehicle and read her implied consent for the breathe test. Ms. Johnson agree to the breathe test and I then detained her and had a tow truck started to my location. I informed Sgt Henry, Unit 1594, of the situation and after A-Tow impounded her vehicle transported Ms. Johnson to the Georgia Tech Police Precinct for the breathe test.Ms. Johnson was given the chemical breathe test on the Georgia Model Intoxilyzer 9000 (Inst Serial #90-000653, Lot # 22315080A4) by GA Tech PD OFC Manuel Blair (Permit #951312, Exp Date 11/01/2019) Ms. Johnson was then given two breathe tests to see what her BAC levels were.

Mr. Medici stated the male was standing by the Jeep and that the vehicle's interior lights were on. Mr. Medici stated that the suspect walked away from him and back down the parking deck. Mr. Medici stated that he followed the male in his vehicle until the male had exited the parking deck and they were both in coverage of the video cameras when he spoke with the male. Mr. Medici stated that the male stated that he was not a resident of the building and, when asked for identification, quickly flashed a Georgia identification or driver's license that appeared to bear the suspect's image. Mr. Medici advised that the name given to him was Anthony HOWARD JR. Mr. Medici was not able to provide a date of birth to go along with the name. Mr. Medici stated that the male was carrying a black lap top computer bag with some manner of white art decal on the top. Mr. Medici stated that he asked Mr. Howard to show him the contents of the back, and when the back was opened, Mr. Medici stated that he saw a black laptop computer inside, along with several power cords and other small items. Mr. Medici stated that he asked the male to hang out with him in an effort to stall the male's departure until police arrival, but Mr. Howard declined and walked towards the Beltline. Mr. Medici described the clothing of the suspect and stated that the male was around 6'2" in height and had tattoos on both of his arms, with a thin beard.  Mr. Medici showed me photos on his phone sent to him from his security dispatch. They show a black male matching the description given by Mr. Medici. Mr. Medici advised that these were photos of the male just prior to entering. The male in the photos does not appear to be carrying a laptop bag in the photos. Mr. Medici showed us the vehicle in question where he initially spotted the male. Mr. Medici stated that the vehicle had its doors unlocked and the interior light was on. When we observed it, the doors were closed and the light was off. A check of the vehicle's tag ( Florida Tag: AVFP70 ) showed the owner to be a Geri Michelle Williams, who lived on the property, supposedly in apartment 1411. Mr. Medici took myself and Ofc. Smith to apartment 1411 where we knocked several times and announced ourselves. No one came to the door. Mr. Medici was advised of the case information and stated, per my request, that he would contact his dispatch to keep the relevant videos and photos on hold.

161960597	4	On 7/14/2016 at around 0815 hours, a burglary took place at 976 N Ormewood Park Dr SE, Atlanta, Fulton County, in which a television was stolen. The burglary itself was captured on video and one suspect can be seen walking around with a firearm in his hand before passing the gun off to the other suspect. The empty handed suspect grabs the 60" television and both run outside to a waiting green Jeep Cherokee. The Cherokee is known because a witness saw it in front of the house.I checked our report database and discovered a green 2001 Jeep Cherokee had been reported stolen just a few hours prior, which is documented under Case # 161960597. The Jeep bore Georgia PMT8029.The video of the burglary was distributed to the media and a crimestoppers tip was received identifying the heavyset black male as "Big Boy".  The tipster also said the Jeep Cherokee could be found at 4371 Glenwood Rd, Decatur. On 07/15/2016, DeKalb Police recovered the stolen green Jeep Cherokee (abandoned) from 4371 Glenwood Rd.An investigator from DeKalb PD, South Precinct, received an additional tip that "Big Boy" was actually "Rashad". The person providing the information also knew the Instagram account name for "Rashad". I began following "Rashad" on Instagram and after viewing pictures he had posted of himself, I believed him to be one of the persons in the burglary video. "Rashad" then posted a video that led us to a hotel located at 1900 Glenfair Rd, Decatur. On 7/25/2016, I and Officer Laplante went to the hotel to discover numerous DeKalb Police officers on scene for an unrelated incident. This incident brought most occupants outside at which time we were able to observe "Rashad" standing on a walkway. "Rashad" and friends then walked into room #256 as they saw Police approach. I knocked on the door and it was opened by a female occupant. I could see "Rashad" sitting in a chair so I asked him to step out. I asked his name and he identified himself as Rashed Jackson. I explained to Jackson that I had a video of him and a friend committing a burglary and asked if he would be willing to tell me about it. He said he would so we transported Rashed to 4371 Glenwood Rd so I could speak with his mother, Quachia Jackson. Ms. Jackson stated she would not be able to meet with us at the precinct but made it very clear that she would allow us to interview Rashed without her being present.On 7/25/2016 at 1529 hours, I told Rashed that he was a suspect in a burglary, I explained what a burglary was and then I read aloud to Rashed form APD 905, waiver of counsel by defendant in custody. Rashed stated  he understood and waived which is documented by his signature.Rashed did admit that he was one of the individuals inside the home and even said he saw himself on the news. He said it was hours after the burglary that he and his accomplice sold the television to an unknown person on the street. The pair was paid $100 which Rashed got $50 of.I then showed Rashed a picture of the rear of a stolen green Jeep Cherokee (unique due to stickers) and he confirmed that was the Jeep they used in said burglary. Rashed went on to say that he watched his friend,  a co-conspirator, steal the Jeep. Rashed along with another unknown male sat in nearby car and watched out as the 3rd suspect committed the auto theft. This theft took place on 07/14/2016 at around 0300 hours from 1140 North Ave NE, Atlanta, Fulton County and was documented under Case # 161960597.Rashed said that after the burglary at 976 N Ormewood Park Dr, he was upset with himself and demanded that he be driven back to the hotel on Glenfair. After dropping off Rashed, the other two occupants left and committed at least one other burglary using this Jeep. This is known due to stolen property being found inside the Jeep at the time of recovery. Rashed was adamant that he only participated in the one burglary he admitted to.Note: Rashed stated the firearm he possessed during the burglary was a Ruger 9mm.Warran

161960597	4	On 7/14/2016 at around 0815 hours, a burglary took place at 976 N Ormewood Park Dr SE, Atlanta, Fulton County, in which a television was stolen. The burglary itself was captured on video and one suspect can be seen walking around with a firearm in his hand before passing the gun off to the other suspect. The empty handed suspect grabs the 60" television and both run outside to a waiting green Jeep Cherokee. The Cherokee is known because a witness saw it in front of the house.I checked our report database and discovered a green 2001 Jeep Cherokee had been reported stolen just a few hours prior, which is documented under Case # 161960597. The Jeep bore Georgia PMT8029.The video of the burglary was distributed to the media and a crimestoppers tip was received identifying the heavyset black male as "Big Boy".  The tipster also said the Jeep Cherokee could be found at 4371 Glenwood Rd, Decatur. On 07/15/2016, DeKalb Police recovered the stolen green Jeep Cherokee (abandoned) from 4371 Glenwood Rd.An investigator from DeKalb PD, South Precinct, received an additional tip that "Big Boy" was actually "Rashad". The person providing the information also knew the Instagram account name for "Rashad". I began following "Rashad" on Instagram and after viewing pictures he had posted of himself, I believed him to be one of the persons in the burglary video. "Rashad" then posted a video that led us to a hotel located at 1900 Glenfair Rd, Decatur. On 7/25/2016, I and Officer Laplante went to the hotel to discover numerous DeKalb Police officers on scene for an unrelated incident. This incident brought most occupants outside at which time we were able to observe "Rashad" standing on a walkway. "Rashad" and friends then walked into room #256 as they saw Police approach. I knocked on the door and it was opened by a female occupant. I could see "Rashad" sitting in a chair so I asked him to step out. I asked his name and he identified himself as Rashed Jackson. I explained to Jackson that I had a video of him and a friend committing a burglary and asked if he would be willing to tell me about it. He said he would so we transported Rashed to 4371 Glenwood Rd so I could speak with his mother, Quachia Jackson. Ms. Jackson stated she would not be able to meet with us at the precinct but made it very clear that she would allow us to interview Rashed without her being present.On 7/25/2016 at 1529 hours, I told Rashed that he was a suspect in a burglary, I explained what a burglary was and then I read aloud to Rashed form APD 905, waiver of counsel by defendant in custody. Rashed stated  he understood and waived which is documented by his signature.Rashed did admit that he was one of the individuals inside the home and even said he saw himself on the news. He said it was hours after the burglary that he and his accomplice sold the television to an unknown person on the street. The pair was paid $100 which Rashed got $50 of.I then showed Rashed a picture of the rear of a stolen green Jeep Cherokee (unique due to stickers) and he confirmed that was the Jeep they used in said burglary. Rashed went on to say that he watched his friend,  a co-conspirator, steal the Jeep. Rashed along with another unknown male sat in nearby car and watched out as the 3rd suspect committed the auto theft. This theft took place on 07/14/2016 at around 0300 hours from 1140 North Ave NE, Atlanta, Fulton County and was documented under Case # 161960597.Rashed said that after the burglary at 976 N Ormewood Park Dr, he was upset with himself and demanded that he be driven back to the hotel on Glenfair. After dropping off Rashed, the other two occupants left and committed at least one other burglary using this Jeep. This is known due to stolen property being found inside the Jeep at the time of recovery. Rashed was adamant that he only participated in the one burglary he admitted to.Note: Rashed stated the firearm he possessed during the burglary was a Ruger 9mm.Warran

161911410	4	On July 9, 2016, I, Ofc. K. Nachreiner responded to 44 North Ave. in regards to a larceny from vehicle. Once on scene I was approached by Mr. Kiel Johanson who stated he was removing a boot from a black Dodge Dart with a Georgia tag: RZZ5384. The driver of that vehicle had just finished paying for the boot removal and once Mr. Johanson left his vehicle, with the window's down, the suspect reached in the car and took a Samsung cell phone.  Mr. Johanson has the incident on video from the video camera that was inside his vehicle. Mr. Chip Schmeelk can be contacted to view the footage at (404) 376-3732. The driver of that vehicle was inside the restaurant Negrsl Village and they may have more information on his identity.

161910908	4	On July 09 2016 I Officer Beauvil (2137) and Officer Lake (2135) were patrolling the area of Northside Drive and Joseph E Boone. While patrolling the area Officer Hemphill 2136 and Ofc Spear 2132 informed me that they were following a silver in color Acura GA TAG RBI8291 heading eastbound on North Avenue. Officer Hemphill informed me that they saw the vehicle run a stop sign at the intersection of North Avenue and Griffin Street. They were unable to stop the vehicle because they were in an unmarked vehicle. We then got behind the vehicle and was able to conduct a traffic stop at the location of 610 Spring Street in Zone 5. I approached the vehicle and was greeted by Mr. Gabriel Myers W/M DOB 10-17-1997 (driver) the passenger later identified as Mr. Chase Hunter W/M 10-23-1996. I informed the driver the reason why he was stopped was because I was informed by my partner Officer Hemphill that he ran a stop sign at the location of North Ave and Griffin Street. While doing my investigation Officer Spear informed me that he was able to smell raw marijuana inside of the vehicle, the marijuana was then located in the center console of the vehicle inside of a Mcdonalds cup containing Ice-Tea inside of it. The marijuana was inside of a ziploc bag. When we asked Mr. Myers and Mr. Hunter who was the owner of the illegal substance none of them would admit to someone being the owner. We informed both subjects if one of them would admit to who was the rightful owner because the marijuana was in the wingspan of both of them. Both males after 5-10 minutes would not take ownership of the marijuana. Mr. Myers and Mr. Hunter were then placed in custody and taken to  Atlanta city Jail, Mr. Myers charged with 40-6-72b (failure to obey stop sign) 16-13-2b Possesion of marijuana less then an ounce, Mr. Myers was charged with 16-13-2b possesion of marijuana less then an oz.. Before Mr. Hunter was transported to Atlanta City Jail he started throwing-up, we asked if he needed any medical attention but informed us that he was just nauseous. The vehicle was towed by A-tow and both males were taken to Atlanta City Jail. Nothing further to advise.

Per Morris, this male threw what is believed to have been a bottle at the MARTA bus. The bottle made contact with the front accordion door, causing damage. Darnell was only able to advise that the male was an older black male wearing a peach or faded orange shirt, and he did not see which direction the male went after throwing the bottle.Looking at the passenger door, the right side glass, closest to the front of the bus, cracked in a circular spider web pattern, consistent with impact to the glass.

I asked if at any point the verbal altercation turned physical and his wife Katherine Branch, who was standing in the doorway of the location, yelled out "he shoved me". I asked Browne if he shoved her and he stated "yes, because she wouldn't get out the bathroom". I then placed Browne in handcuffs (double locked), searched him incident to lawful arrest, and sat him in the back of my patrol car while I collected a witness statement from Branch. Branch did not have any visible marks, but stated he shoved her several times during the argument and that she could not remember the exact number of times.

The victim indicated that the assault occurred in a small patch of bushes near the intersection of N. Angier Ave NE and Dallas St. NE in the corner of the park.  The location was dimmly lit by street lighting in the area and the grass and mulch near the location was still damp from recent rainfall in the area.  The victim led me to the location and crime scene unit #7338 photographed the location to its entirity.I spoke to the victim who stated that she had left her friend, who is the reporting party, and was promptly asked to leave the nightclub for unknown reasons.  She stated further that the subject who led her out of the bar held her by her arm and escorted her approximately a block and a half to the incident location.  The subject pushed her into the bushes and pulled her pants down and penetrated her vaginally pushing her tampon inside of her.  The subject was on top of her holding her throat.  She could not advise if the subject wore a condom, or ejaculated.  She described the subject as black or mixed race wearing dark clothing, jeans, and a ski mask.  The victim appeared to be intoxicated at the time I interviewed her, however stated that she had only had 2 drinks.I also spoke with Mr. Dyer who stated that the victim was near him most of the night until around 2200 hrs, where she stated she was going to the bathroom.

Mr. Dyer stated that himself and the victim have been friends since elementary school.I spoke to Mr. Daniel Austin, head of security for the nightclub, who stated that cameras in the club are live feed only and doesn't believe that the cameras record.  He indicated that only one female was removed from the club, however her male companion was removed at the same time.  He believed the two bouncers involved were Jeremy and Taylor.I then spoke to Officer D. Somers, who was working security off duty at the nightclub.  He removed a female from the bar for reaching over a bar near the front entrance, and bringing outside liquor into the club.  He stated that he never touched the female and the bar was right next to the entrance where she was asked to depart.  The female stayed out in front of the bar for a minute or two, attempting to make a phone call and walked away toward the park across the street.The victim was transported to Grady Memorial Hospital, 80 Jessie Hill Jr. Dr. SE for a sexual assault exam that was performed by Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner Samantha Murphy.  The kit was recovered at Grady Hospital and transported back to police headquarters, logged, and placed into the SVU Lockbox for transport to the GBI DOFS.  The victim's clothing was also recovered.

I explained to Mr. Lowe that the strong smell of raw marijuana that's coming out of his vehicle was enough probable cause for me to search his vehicle. I told Mr. Lowe to hand me any marijuana that him and his passenger might have on their person.  Mr. Lowe turned his attention to his passenger Mr. Fambles Gregory DOB 05-12-1962 and stated that his passenger was known to use marijuana and he was the one with the marijuana on his person. I Asked Mr. Fambles to hand me the marijuana and also told him that he was only going to be cited for possession of marijuana less than 1oz.

After observing Mr. Fambles's behavior, I decided to pay more attention to him and his movements.  As Mr. Fambles was moving around in an attempt to hide the narcotics that he had on his person, he accidently exposed the open can of beer that he was hiding. After I Noticed that Mr. Fambles had an open container. I gave him verbal command to step out of the vehicle. As Mr. Fambles was stepping out of the vehicle he turned his back on me and refused to turned around and show me his hands. At that point I pulled out my city issued weapon and aimed my weapon at low ready and ordered to Mr. Fambles to show me his hands. As Mr. Fambles was turning around he pulled out a prescription bottle and swallows all the pills that were inside of it. Mr. Fambles was taken to the ground in an attempt to handcuff him, but he wouldn't comply. Mr. Fambles refused to put his hands behind his back for a short time. While attempting to restrain Mr. Fambles I was able to free one of my hands and reached for my radio and asked dispatched for one more unit.  Mr. Fambles Never swung at me nor did I swing at him; the struggle was only to get his hands and put him in handcuff. I was able to get Mr. Fambles in handcuffs before the arrival of units. Mr. Fambles was questioned on scene and was asked to disclose the type of narcotics he had ingested. Mr. Fambles refused to say. Grady 604 was called on scene to treat Mr. Fambles.

161782308	4	On June 26, 2016 at 9:28pm Unit#3631 Officer Gilstrap and I, Officer D. Smith II was performing a traffic stop in the area of North Avenue NE and Central Park Place NE, on a 2012 Toyota Prius, green in color. The driver was traveling south on Boulevard NE and made a right turn onto North Avenue NE without using the turning signal. It turned into the center lane, not utilizing the immediate right lane. I noticed the two infractions and followed the vehicle west on North Avenue. The vehicle changed lanes to the far right lane, and immediately crossed back to the center lane. It attempted to merge between to other traveling vehicles in the far right lane, and at that time, I decided to make the traffic stop using the emergency equipment on the marked Atlanta Police patrol car. Once the vehicle came to a stop, I approached the driver side of the vehicle, as Officer Gilstrap approached the passenger side. Mrs. Maria Evans was the driver of the vehicle. I told Mrs. Evans what traffic violations she violated and asked for her driver license. She stated that she didn't have her driver license because she was a victim of a crime where it was stolen. She showed me a police report with her name on it. While interacting with Mrs. Evans I smelled an odor of raw marijuana coming from the vehicle. I asked Mrs. Evans if there were any drugs in the vehicle, and she stated no. I advised Mrs. Evans that I smelled marijuana coming from the vehicle, and she stated that it might be coming from her husband, Mr. Kevin Evans, who was sitting in the passenger seat holding onto his black backpack placed between his legs on the floor. She stated that she had just picked him up from a party, where people inside was smoking weed. Mr. Evans acknowledged, and agreed with her statement. I asked Mrs. Evans if a narcotic K-9 was brought to the scene would it find any drugs in the vehicle, and she stated that she didn't think so. At that time Mr. and Mrs. Evans was asked to step out of the vehicle. Both were detained, with handcuffs that were double locked, being placed on Mr. Evans. I told Mrs. Evans that if she was to cooperate, give me the marijuana that was in the vehicle, I wouldn't take her to jail if it was less than one ounce. I advised her that she would get a citation for the infractions, but she wouldn't go to jail. After the proposal Mrs. Evans decided to cooperate and give me the drugs. I allowed her to approach the vehicle where she retrieved a white Michael Kors backpack from the rear passenger seat, placed behind where Mr. Evans was sitting. She unzipped the bag and pulled out a small plastic bag filled with a green leafy substance that appeared to be marijuana. I asked if there were any more drugs inside the vehicle, and she stated no. I searched the vehicle with no other drugs being found inside the vehicle.  I performed an ACIC inquiry on both Mr. and Mrs. Evans with Mr. Evans showing to have a warrant out of DeKalb County for probation violation on a theft by taking, criminal damage 2nd degree charge. Warrant# 10CR3568 was issued on December 29, 2015. The warrant was confirmed with Mr. Evans being searched, and placed inside the patrol vehicle. We were allowing Mr. Evans to give his belongings to Mrs. Evans, when I noticed him retrieving a small plastic bag with something in it from his pants waistline area passing it to Mrs. Evans.  Mrs. Evans attempted to conceal the small package from my view, and walked away towards her vehicle. I followed her, asking her what was in her hand. She turned around with one hand hidden behind her back, and the other showing me a cloth that would be used to clean eye glasses. I asked to see the hidden hand and she handed me a small plastic bag filled with a different variety of blue and yellow pills. It also contained hard white substance which appeared to be crack cocaine, along with some clear crystal looking substance. After Mrs. Evans handed me the drugs, she attempted to take the blame for them, by

161751989	4	On June 23, 2016, at approximately 1539 Hrs, I (Officer L Delain) was in the area of North Ave and English Ave when I observed a red 2010 Chevy Impala with Ga tag QAK9641. I ran the tag on my mobile MDT and received a hit that the vehicle had suspended registration. I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle at 854 North Ave Nw and made contact with the driver/arrestee #1 Ms. Andrea HILTON. I advised Ms. HILTON who I was and why I was stopping her. Ms. HILTON quickly advised me the vehicle was not hers and the owner was in the back seat. Due to the dark tint on the back windows, I had Ms. HILTON roll the windows down so I could speak with the register owner/Arrestee #2 Mr. Rodney LEWIS. I began to speak with Mr. LEWIS and was able to obtain his driver license. I returned back to my patrol car and ran Ms. HILTON and Mr. LEWIS both on ACIC radio. ACIC advised me that Ms. HILTON was actively wanted out of Riverdale PD on a FTA shoplifting warrant. Warrant #15431719A DOW: 5/12/216. ACIC also advised me Mr. LEWIS was actively wanted out of College Park PD for hit and run. Warrant #1607082 DOW: 6/20/2016. Sgt. Vayens 2197 and I returned back to the vehicle and placed Ms. HILTON and Mr. LEWIS under arrest and secured them in the rear of my patrol car. I conducted an inventory of the vehicle prior to the vehicle being towed by S&W towing. I opened the driver door and began to look for any valuable items and/or contraband. I noticed the door handle on the driver door panel looked as if it was tampered with. I lifted the rubber piece that was located in the door panel and underneath was a small clear baggie with a white powdery substance. Based on my knowledge, training, and experience I recognized the substance as suspected powder cocaine. I continued to inventory the vehicle and got to the back passenger seat area where Mr. LEWIS was sitting at. In that door panel, in plain view I observed a small green baggie commonly used in narcotics with a white rock substance in it. I recovered the baggie and I recognized the rock as suspected crack/cocaine. I also recovered two short straws from the floor board area and based on my knowledge, training, and experience straws are used to snort cocaine into the nose. I returned back to my patrol and advised Ms. HILTON and Mr. LEWIS that they were both going to be charged with possession of cocaine. S&W towing arrived on scene and towed the vehicle away. I transported Ms. HILTON and Mr. LEWIS to Fulton County jail without incident. Riverdale PD warrant system was currently down and they couldn't provide a warrant hit for Ms. HILTON. I advised Riverdale PD and GCIC on the system problem and just booked Ms. HILTON in on the possession of Cocaine charge. I placed the suspected narcotics into property as evidence along with Mr. LEWIS cell phone. Sgt. Vayens 2197 was present during the incident. Nothing more

This caused Driver 2 to side swipe Driver 1s vehicle. This caused Driver 2 to swerve into the left hand turn lane, which was occupied by Driver 3s vehicle. I observed slight damage to the 1, and 11 O'clock position of Driver 2s vehicle. Driver 2 had Passenger 1 in their vehicle as well. Both Driver 2 and Passenger 1 stated they did not sustain any injuries from the accident. Driver 1 stated they were driver their vehicle (Silver Mitsubishi Galant GA Tag: QAN1622) west on North Ave, approaching Techwood Dr in the right hand lane. Driver 1 stated that they were stopped in traffic and needed to change lanes into the lane to their left. Driver 1 stated that they had fully changed into the left hand lane when Driver 2 struck their vehicle on the drivers side. I observed slight damage to the 8, 9, and 10 O'clock position of Driver 1s vehicle. Driver 1 stated they did not sustain any injuries from the accident. Driver 3 stated they were driving their vehicle (Silver Volkswagen Passat CA Tag: 6RMM059) west on North Ave, stopped at the left turn lane at the intersection of North Ave and Techwood Dr to turn south on to Centennial Olympic Park Dr. Driver 3 stated that they were stopped at the intersection when Driver 2s vehicle side swiped their vehicle. I observed slight damage to the 2, 3 and 4 O'clock position of Driver 3s vehicle. Taking into account statements from all parties involved and observing damage from all three vehicles I have labeled Driver 1 at fault for improper lane change. Driver 1 was also cited for the violation. While running Driver 1s information on my MDT and confirming on ACIC I was informed that Driver 1s drivers license was suspended. Driver 1 was placed into custody for driving on a suspended license and transported to Grady to be cleared medically for being in an accident prior to arrest. Driver 1s property was placed in to city property (purse, cellphone, and keys) and their vehicle was towed from the scene by A-tow. Driver 2s supervisor responded to the scene as well as the ID unit to document the damage to the city vehicle.Driver 2 and Driver 3 were able to drive their vehicles away from the scene. No injuries were reported at this time.
161671660	4	On 6-15-16 at approximately 1440 hours, I, Investigator P. Harris and Investigator G. Smith were traveling west bound in the left lane on North avenue coming up on the intersection of Techwood when a silver Mitsubishi Galant traveling west bound in the right lane made an improper lane change as I was passing.  When I noticed the driver of the vehicle entering into my lane, I blow my horn, hit my brakes to avoid hitting the vehicle, but still made contact with the Galant, which caused me to hit a silver Volkswagen Jetta that was traveling west bound on North avenue in the turning lane at the intersection.  After the accident, myself and the two vehicles pulled over to right side of the road way to make sure there was no injuries that needed to be addressed.  Then I obtained both females licenses and insurance cards and ran them on acic to make sure their license and insurance were valid.  Investigator Smith notified the zone as well as the zone supervisor of the vehicle accident, requested crime scene and our unit supervisors.  Crime scene technician Ware came out to the scene, Officer Peterson handled the accident report and Sergeant Walls was present at the location.  No injuries was reported by all drivers and passengers.
161671660	4	On 06-15-16 Det. P. Harris and myself, Det. G. A. Smith were travelling westbound in the center lane of North avenue, while approaching the intersection of Techwood drive.  Det. Harris who was operating a marked city vehicle quickly blew the vehicle's horn in an attempt to alert the driver of a silver automobile, who were travelling in the right lane, while simultaneously slamming on the brakes.  The driver abruptly started entering into our lane of travel with complete disregard of our right of way.  However, the driver did utilized their left turn signal as she quickly entered into our path of direction.  In my experience and observation, I believe she did not see us due to being in her driver's side blind spot.  This action resulted in her side swiping the city's vehicle and forcing our vehicle to side swipe the vehicle that was in the left turing lane.  After the accident, all involved parties pulled over to the far right lane after crossing the intersection.  Det. Harris immediately checked for injuries, while I notified our supervisors, identification unit, and zone unit regarding the accident.  See primary officer's incident report for details.

Both started with the same information, which was Mr. Springer was away in Europe for two weeks and allowed Ms. Thomas stay in his home while he was gone. While he was gone, the both of them argued about the title of their relationship. They have only known each other since April. Upon his arrival from Europe today was when the two stories were not alike...Ms. Thomas states when he walked through the door, he was in rage and started to kick her out of his apartment. She refused to leave only because her belongings were still in his home. She stated that she had just finished cleaning up the apartment before he arrived home and he walked in with a great rage. She stated he pushed her out by grabbing her throat and pushing her out of the apartment and after finally getting her out, he slapped her with an open hand on the right side of her face.

Mr. Springer stated that when she arrived home, they began talking about the "title" of their relationship. He says she grow angry and started the physical altercation by throwing a Fabreeze bottle at him, which he showed to me flying on the floor.

Items were clearly thrown all over the apartment- candle holders, clothes, coins, etc. Mr. Springer stated that he told her that she needed to leave his home since these were continuing to be her actions. She refused to leave, so he pushed her out of his apartment as she fought with him to not leave. After he got her out, she kept yelling and banging on his door stating that she needed to get her things out of his apartment. He told her that he would let her in only to get her things and then to leave. She agreed and entered back into the apartment. Initially, she entered in a calm manner. Then she went in the back bedroom and Mr. Springer saw that she started throwing items around in the bedroom. After such, Mr. Springer decided that she needed to leave his apartment again. She refused to leave, therefore, in the same manner as before, he put out. At one point, Mr. Springer was able to get a friend of his on his cell phone and told his friend to call 911 for him, which he did. Ms. Thomas later called 911 as well. Mr. Springer stated, prior to my arrival, that Ms. Thomas made a statement, "I know where you live and I know where you work.

I had received a lead sheet advising crack cocaine and marijuana was being sold from this location.  The confidential source used for this attempted narcotics purchase  was 13-0024.

I asked Ms. Isabel where she was coming form and she stated she was coming from a friends house. I asked her how much she had to drink tonight, and she stated that she had "like 2 drinks". I asked her if it was just the 2 and she stated just the 2 drinks. I asked Ms. Deleon for her drivers license. She began to look around her vehicle, and purse but was unable to find it. She stated that she had it earlier when she bought cigarettes but did not know where it was.I asked Ms. Deleon to go ahead and step out of the vehicle, so I could perform some tests on her.

I informed her to go ahead and place her left foot on the line, and her right foot heel to toe in front of her left. I then informed her that when I told her to start she would take 9 heel to toe steps on the line, pivot around on her pivot foot, and take 9 heel to toe steps back on the line. I demonstrated the test by taking 3 heel to toe steps on the line, showing her how to correctly pivot and taking 3 heel to toe steps back on the line. I informed her that during the test to make sure she kept her hands down by her side, keep her head down looking at her feet, to count each step out loud and to make sure she did not stop until I told her to. I asked her if she understood my instructions and she stated that she did.I informed Ms. Deleon to go ahead and start the test.

161461773	4	ON 05/25/2016 at approximately 2:00PM, I (Ofc. H. Vernon/Unit #2504) responded to an Information on a Pedestrian Struck call at 310 North Ave NW (Coca Cola Headquarters).Upon my arrival, I met with the caller, Evelyn Fields, who stated that this morning around 8:30AM, as she was working the front check-in gate at the above-mentioned location, a vehicle (black 2011 GMC Yukon Denali;GA Tag: LM6813) that was pulling in, struck her, when their front tire went over the curb where she was standing. She said the driver's side-mirror hit her right arm, and caused the clipboard she was holding to hit her in the chest. She stated the vehicle made the loop of the entrance, and when it came back to exit, her supervisor waved him down and asked, "Are you going to say you are 'Sorry'?", to which he claimed the driver said, "I already did." and then drove away.When asked why she did not call police initially, Ms. Fields said she did not know what she needed to do. She stated she reported it to the security consult inside within the company. She now wishes to make a police report as she is feeling pain in her arm, chest, and neck.
161462846	4	On May 25, 2016 at approximately 8:15PM, I, Officer Wertz (3602), responded to a traffic accident at the intersection of Boulevard Ave and North Ave.  Upon arrival, I observed vehicle one off the roadway with extensive damage and driver one complaining of injuries.  Driver two, Franklin WALTON, was standing with vehicle two which had a moderate amount of damage.  The driver presented an odor of alcoholic beverage initially.  I asked for his cellphone number, but he was unable to recall it.  WALTON was unable to explain where he was driving from or where he was driving to. The passenger compartment of his vehicle had a strong odor of alcoholic beverage.  A blue solo cup was found crushed between the front, passenger seat and front, passenger door.  A liquid, smelling of alcoholic beverage, was sprayed across the front, passenger seat as well as the dashboard, the headliner, and the windshield in the passenger's area.  I returned to WALTON to continue my investigation for a possible DUI alcohol.  Upon returning to him after collecting additional information from all parties, I smelled a strong fragrance/cologne.  I asked again where he was coming from and where he was going.  WALTON seemed very confused.  He was still unable to maintain balance and was wavering even while seated in the rear, driver's side seat.  Eventually, he was able to say he was coming from visiting a friend downtown.  Downtown would place him driving west to east, but he was driving east to west.  WALTON advised he had a beer earlier - maybe an hour or two earlier.  I asked what time he thought it currently was, and he advised 6PM.  He thought he had his beer around 4PM but could not advise the brand.  After a few more questions, I asked again what time he thought it was, and he advised 6:30PM.  WALTON, after I asked, thought he had his beer around 4:30PM.  WALTON did admit that the blue solo cup did contain beer.  I asked WALTON if he was wearing contacts, if he felt he had a head injury, or if he has ever been diagnosed with nystagmus, and he said "no" to each question.  I then asked if he would go through an evaluation, and he agreed.  I began the horizontal gaze nystagmus evaluation (HGN).  WALTON was unable to continuously follow my finger using just his eyes.  His eyes would follow for a moment and then revert there gaze to my face.  I gave him several reminders until it was clear he was unable to complete the evaluation.  Due to him having a neck brace on and being unable to look at his feet, I did not continue with the walk and turn or one leg stand.  Once he was on the Grady ambulance, I placed him in handcuffs and read Implied Consent Notice for Suspects Age 21 or Over.  He asked me to repeat it, so I re-read it.  He gave consent for a blood draw.  I then followed behind his Grady ambulance to Grady.  A cammo color, zipped bag was in his possession.  A scale, a container of suspected marijuana remainings, and small, empty baggies were in the bag's contents.  The bag had an odor of marijuana.  WALTON then claimed to have smoked earlier but could not advise, specifically, when.  He did not believe it to be recent.  Jennifer PHELPS (RN) drew his blood after Implied Consent Notice for Suspects Age 21 or Over was read, again, in her presence.  WALTON gave consent again.  Items related to suspected marijuana were entered into evidence at the Annex, and his property was entered into property at the Annex.  Sgt. Smith was advised.

161450036	4	On May 24th, 2016 at 12:02 am I was sitting in my patrol vehicle at a red light at the intersection of Luckie St and North Ave NW and I observed a vehicle pull to the red light opposite me.  The driver in the vehicle had his cell phone in his hand and in front of his face when he was pulling to the red light.  I initiated a stop on the vehicle using my emergency equipment.  The vehicle was a white 2014 Dodge Charger GA tag: QAB6137.  As I approached the vehicle I could smell a very strong odor of raw marijuana.  I spoke with Mr. Kelvin Davis Jr. whom stated that he was trying to turn on some music through his phone and the radio system.  As I was speaking with Mr. Davis I observed a silver grinder with a dollar sign on it in the center console.  I could see green pieces of marijuana seeds and stems on top of the grinder as well as a large amount of them on the floor and seat of the vehicle.  I asked Mr. Davis for his drivers license as well as the passenger Mr. Jeremy Watts.  Both individuals gave me their licenses.  I checked the licenses over GCIC and they showed in the system.  Mr. Watts was on active probation.  I asked the two to step out of the vehicle and just stand on the sidewalk so that I could search the vehicle incident to the marijuana discovered inside.  I searched the front passenger compartment of the vehicle.  I found a small black container inside of the drivers side door which contained 2 grams of raw marijuana unpackaged.  I detained both Mr. Davis and Mr. Watts incident to finding the marijuana.  I searched the backpack which was sitting right on top of the passengers seat and discovered a black Titanium Taurus .38 cal revolver inside of the pouch of the bag.  I asked Mr. Watts whom the gun belonged to and he stated that it was his.  The serial number on the firearm was filed down so as to conceal the identity of the firearm.  I advised both individuals that they were under arrest.  I charged Mr. Davis with Texting While Driving (Electronic Distraction) (40-6-241) and Marijuana Possession less than 1 oz. (16-13-2b).  I charged Mr. Watts with Marijuana Possession less than 1 oz. (16-13-2b) and Criminal Use of an Article with Altered Identification Mark (16-9-70).

He described Vehicle #1 as a darker color, grey, Nissan Altima, occupied by three(3) Hispanic individuals, the driver being male. He stated that it had a Georgia license plate that was PXN8443. During the investigation, Ofc. N. Pommells (Unit #2505) advised me that he was alerted by a witness to the accident that Vehicle #1 continued toward Freedom Parkway. As he was in the process of conducting a separate accident investigation, he was unable to check the area himself at the time, but requested our dispatcher send another available unit. He was then alerted by another citizen that there was a vehicle described as Vehicle #1 in the area of I-75/85 SB and Freedom Pkwy, where a male and female were attempting to push a vehicle that had heavy front-end damage. After Ofc. Pommells concluded his accident investigation, he headed to the last known location of Vehicle #1, which was still on scene. I then arrived at the location, and saw that the disabled vehicle was a darker grey, Nissan Altima, occupied by three(3) hispanic individuals (1 male driver, 2 female passengers), GA license plate of PXN8843.  Driver #1/Arrestee (VASQUES ZAMORA, Jaime) initially claimed that he was not involved in an accident, and that he was able to avoid it (despite having obvious heavy front-end damage). He then stated that he was involved in an accident with a white Toyota driven by a white female and a grey 2-door sports car (which he later changed to say it was an SUV), no driver described. He claimed that the accident occurred in the area where we had located him. He claimed that he did not believe there was much damage (his car was not driveable due to the damage), so the other drivers left the scene.His passengers had similar stories, but they claimed the driver was a black female and she had a child with her (Vehicle #3 was driven by a black female, who had two children in her vehicle) . It seemed that the females were not even confident in the account they were giving me.The dispatcher advised that the victim was back enroute to the location, VASQUES' was detained in the mean time and placed in the rear of my patrol vehicle. Mr. Khan met with us at the new scene, and positively identified the vehicle and driver as the one that struck his and left.

161092715	4	On 04/18/16 at approximately 7:08PM a business robbery was reported at the Family Dollar store located at 455 North Ave NE Suite A.  The 911 caller was Family Dollar employee Tiawania Davenport, and she advised dispatch that a black male wearing a hat, black jacket and jeans snatched money from the cash register and fled on foot towards Parkway Drive NE.  Zone 6 officers and supervisors responded to the scene and requested a Commercial Robbery Unit.  I (Inv. Buckley) conducted the initial investigation.Summary of incident:On 04/18/16 at approximately 7:04PM the suspect, a black male wearing dark clothes, entered the Family Dollar and loitered near the front of the store and asked customers and an employee for any cash donations that they could spare for him.  At approximately 7:08PM the suspect approached employee Rodney Price, who was working at cash register #1, and when Price tried speaking to the suspect he was ignored.  Price stated that the suspect appeared distant and had heavily blood shot eyes.  The suspect then gestured to a pack of chewing gum that was on a rack in front of the cash register counter, and he asked how much the gum cost.  Rodney Price advised the suspect that the gum cost 36 cents, and the suspect then acted as though he was going to purchase the gum and provided Rodney Price with 50 cents.  When Rodney Price opened the cash register drawer the suspect suddenly lunged over the counter and reached into the opened drawer.  The suspect was able to obtain 1 twenty dollar bill from the cash register, but was blocked by Rodney Price and store manager Walter Parker from removing any additional cash.  Both Rodney Price and manager Walter Parker held the suspects arms down on the counter preventing him from reaching further into the drawer.

161302409	4	On May 9, 2016, I, Officer C. Burrell, was contacted by AMLI Ponce Park regarding a larceny. AMLI Ponce Park is an apartment complex located at 641 North Avenue NE. I am the Atlanta Police Department Courtesy Officer for AMLI Ponce Park and the extra-job position has been approved by the Atlanta Police Department. The assistant property manager at AMLI Ponce Park, Christen, informed me that there was video surveillance of a young male unlawfully entering the "Resident Package Storage Area" and removing two packages. Christen advised me that the larceny occurred on May 4, 2016, at approximately 8:30pm. Christen advised me that this larceny was discovered after a resident inquired about missing packages that were confirmed to be delivered. Christen also informed me that the male had been seen on numerous occassions on the property of AMLI Ponce Park by many members of the AMLI Ponce Park staff. Christen informed me that there is not a young male which matches the demographics on a lease at AMLI Ponce Park. I also spoke with Zac Branson, who conducts maintenance operations at AMLI Ponce Park, and was informed that the young male often frequents the gym, swimming pool, and clubhouse at AMLI Ponce Park. Mr. Branson advised me that he has often seen the male on a bicycle and is sometimes in the company of another young male and sometimes a small puppy. I met with Christen and Mr. Branson at AMLI Ponce Park where I reviewed the video surveillance of the incident. The young male can be seen entering the "Resident Package Storage Area" after following behind a confirmed resident of AMLI Ponce Park. It is important to note that an unique access code is required to enter the package area. After following the female resident into package storage area, the young male appears to use his cell phone and stand near the door of the storage area. The female resident eventually retrieves her package and exits the package storage area, leaving the young male in the room by himself. After the female resident exits the area, the young male immediately puts his phone in his pocket and begins to rummage through numerous packages in the storage area. After rummaging through the packages for approximately 3 minutes, the male picks up a group of packages and exits the room.

He came to MY house. The only thing that I can think of is that he wanted a crowd to let them know that he wasn't gay. I don't know for sure what his motive was. I just know that he chose that moment in front of those people to do it." Mr. King then went on to state, "I think he's (Mr. Griggs) a threat to the gay community because, he came off unintentional, and very unassuming. Sort of like a wolf in sheep's clothing".

He stated to me that he observed the vehicle nearly hit the rear end of another vehicle, he then observed the vehicle cross the intersection at North and Boulevard and drive up onto the side walk nearly hitting a pole. He stated he blue lighted the vehicle, and the vehicle began to move in reverse and nearly hit the front of his vehicle. Ofc. Green stated he had not spoken with the driver.I approached the driver side vehicle and noticed a female slumped over and asleep. I reached in and shut off the car before waking her to make sure it did not move forward when she woke up. After shutting off the car and taking the keys out I woke the driver Ms. Moraiah CARDONA. I immediately could smell a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath. Her eyes were bloodshot red, and watery, and her speech was very slurred. I also noticed a unopened beer in the cup holder. I asked Ms. Cardona if she was ok, and she mumbled and I could not understand her. She then stated to me that she wasn't drinking. I asked her where she was coming from and she stated "not to worry about it". Ms. Cardona still had her head down like she was sleeping, I advised her to wake up.  I then asked her again where she was coming from and she stated that she was coming from a friends house. I asked her how much she had to drink tonight and she stated she had nothing to drink. She also stated she was headed home which was up the way. I asked her to get her Drivers license for me, and she began to look around not knowing where her purse was. I advised her that it was on the floor board. After she handed me her ID, I asked her to step out the vehicle.I brought her to the front of my vehicle. She stumbled out of her vehicle, and swayed from side to side. I continued to smell a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from her breath. I informed her I would be doing some tests on her eyes (Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus). I asked her a series of questions. Are you on any medication? Yes for depression, Have you taken any drugs? No, Do you have any physical disabilities? NO. I informed her that I would be placing a pen light in front of her face and that I would need her to keep her head still and follow the light with her eyes only. I asked her if she understood and she stated that she did.I performed the tests on her. While doing the test, she moved her head and I had to advise her to keep her head still. She also swayed from side to side and also forward and backwards. After performing the tests on her I observed 6 clues, Two clues for Lack of Smooth Pursuit (one in each eye), Two clues for Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Maximum Deviation (one in each eye), and Two clues for Onset Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees (one in each eye).Next I asked Ms. Cardona if she had a high school diploma, and she advised me that she had a college degree. I asked Ms. Cardona if she could cite the alphabet from the letters C to S. Ms. Cardona stated to me that she did not feel like she needed to do that, and that the test was not needed in this situation. I advised her if she wanted to do any further testing, and she advised me that she did not want to do this test, and that she had no choice but to do further testing.I advised Ms. Cardona that she would be doing the next test the walk and turn, and that I would leave it up to her, if she wanted to do it or not. I informed her to listen to my instructions, and not to start until I told her to. I informed her to imagine a straight line from where she was standing to the front of my vehicle. I informed her to go ahead and place her left foot on the line and her right foot heel to toe in front of her left. Ms. Cardona, had a difficult time placing her feet on the line as I had instructed.

161092715	4	On 04/18/16 at approximately 7:08PM a business robbery was reported at the Family Dollar store located at 455 North Ave NE Suite A.  The 911 caller was Family Dollar employee Tiawania Davenport, and she advised dispatch that a black male wearing a hat, black jacket and jeans snatched money from the cash register and fled on foot towards Parkway Drive NE.  Zone 6 officers and supervisors responded to the scene and requested a Commercial Robbery Unit.  I (Inv. Buckley) conducted the initial investigation.Summary of incident:On 04/18/16 at approximately 7:04PM the suspect, a black male wearing dark clothes, entered the Family Dollar and loitered near the front of the store and asked customers and an employee for any cash donations that they could spare for him.  At approximately 7:08PM the suspect approached employee Rodney Price, who was working at cash register #1, and when Price tried speaking to the suspect he was ignored.  Price stated that the suspect appeared distant and had heavily blood shot eyes.  The suspect then gestured to a pack of chewing gum that was on a rack in front of the cash register counter, and he asked how much the gum cost.  Rodney Price advised the suspect that the gum cost 36 cents, and the suspect then acted as though he was going to purchase the gum and provided Rodney Price with 50 cents.  When Rodney Price opened the cash register drawer the suspect suddenly lunged over the counter and reached into the opened drawer.  The suspect was able to obtain 1 twenty dollar bill from the cash register, but was blocked by Rodney Price and store manager Walter Parker from removing any additional cash.  Both Rodney Price and manager Walter Parker held the suspects arms down on the counter preventing him from reaching further into the drawer.  After pulling away from the counter, the suspect fled the area on foot, exiting that store at approximately 7:08PM.  When questioned about the suspect, the Family Dollar employees stated that the suspect did not appear familiar to them and they do not believe he was a regular customer.  Rodney Price stated that he had observed the suspect yesterday evening (on 04/17/16) panhandling at a nearby Popeye's Chicken restaurant located at 683 Boulevard NE.  The crime scene at the Family Dollar was print processed and photographed by APD ID Tech 7342 (Lewis).  This incident was filmed on several security video cameras (timestamp is approx. 2 minutes fast) and the point of contact for the footage is store manager Mahama Virgel (404-934-0486).  No persons reported any injuries from this incident.Suspect Description:Black male, medium complexion, age 24 to 30, 6'00" to 6'03" with a slim to medium build with a full beard / goatee.  The suspect was wearing a black jacket, dark jeans, a black t-shirt, black shoes with a white stripe and white trim (possibly Fila brand) and a black and white 'trucker' style baseball cap (black in the front, white on the rear).Additional Information: At approximately 8:20PM the same suspect from this Family Dollar robbery entered the Waffle House at 112 Courtland Street NE and begged employees and customers for money.  After loitering inside and outside of the Waffle House for about 15 minutes, the suspect purchased a Sprite soda.  When the female Waffle House employee opened the cash register drawer, the suspect reached over the counter and stole approximately $170.00 in paper cash.  The suspect fled on foot and is believed to have dropped his hat while running from the scene (same hat he wore during the Family Dollar robbery).

The suspect, later identified as Lamar Poss, would enter a business or restaurant and would make a small purchase or ask to change a bill then would suddenly lunge over the check-out counter and reach into the cash register drawer and snatch paper currency then flee the area on foot.  The robbery incidents that have been linked to Lamar Poss include:-Case 161070763 (CVS at 235 Peachtree Street on 04/16/16; classed as a Disorderly Conduct)-Case 161072582 (Burger King at 386 North Avenue on 04/16/16; assigned to Zone 6 CID)-Case 161080330 (Walgreens at 595 Piedmont Avenue on 04/17/16; assigned to Zone 6 CID)-Case 161092715 (Family Dollar at 455 North Avenue on 04/18/16)-Case 161092893 (Waffle House at 112 Courtland Street on 04/18/16)-Case 161361778 (Taco Bell at 429 Ponce de Leon Ave on 05/15/16)-Case 161362184 (McDonald's at 80 Jesse Hill Jr Drive on 05/15/16)-Case 161362500 (BP gas station at 610 Spring Street on 05/15/16)-Case 161370863 (CVS at 439 Highland Avenue NE on 05/16/16)Departmental bulletins containing images of the suspect (prior to his identification) were issued via city email on 04/18/16 and again on 05/15/16.  Approximately two hours after the last robbery occurred (the incident at the CVS at 439 Highland Avenue NE on 05/16/16) officers working a detail at Renaissance Park (501 Piedmont Avenue) observed the suspect walking and recognized him from the email bulletins and from the clothing description that was aired on police radio reference the CVS robbery on Highland Avenue that had occurred a short time earlier.  The suspect was detained and subsequently identified as Lamar Boris Poss with a date of birth of 05/02/85 (see supplemental report by Officer Bursby under case 161370863 for additional details).  After being detained Lamar Poss was transported to Atlanta Police Headquarters and was placed in an interview room (Interview 1).  The interview room is video and audio monitored and recorded.  Lamar Poss was read his Constitutional Rights verbatim from a departmental form and both verbally and in writing acknowledged that he was willing to make a statement to police.  During the first part of the interview Lamar Poss spoke with Inv. Gilliard and Inv. Foster of the Commercial Robbery Unit, and Poss confessed to robbing the CVS located at 439 Highland Avenue NE earlier in the day.  Lamar Poss was questioned about several other incidents but initially denied involvement.  Zone 6 Investigator Stellingburg also interviewed Lamar Poss regarding the robberies at the Burger King at 386 North Avenue on 04/16/16 (Case 161072582) and the Walgreens at 595 Piedmont Avenue on 04/17/16 (Case 161080330) and Poss provided information about the incidents but did not admit to any direct involvement.  I (Inv. Buckley) then interviewed Lamar Poss regarding the two robberies which occurred on 04/18/16 (Cases 161092715 and 161092893) and the three robberies which occurred 05/15/16 (Cases 161361778, 161362184 and 161362500). Lamar Poss indicated that he has a substance abuse problem and did confess to committing the five robberies I questioned him about.  Poss believed that he was committing a "misdemeanor" when he snatched money from the cash drawers, and described specifics of each incident that could only be known by the perpetrator.  When asked about the Family Dollar incident (455 North Ave) and the Waffle House incident (112 Courtland) that occurred on 04/18/16, Lamar Poss described that during the Family Dollar incident he purchased a pack of chewing gum in order to gain access to the cash register drawer (this is consistent with the facts of the incident).

161092715	4	On 04/18/16 at approximately 7:08PM a business robbery was reported at the Family Dollar store located at 455 North Ave NE Suite A.  The 911 caller was Family Dollar employee Tiawania Davenport, and she advised dispatch that a black male wearing a hat, black jacket and jeans snatched money from the cash register and fled on foot towards Parkway Drive NE.  Zone 6 officers and supervisors responded to the scene and requested a Commercial Robbery Unit.  I (Inv. Buckley) conducted the initial investigation.Summary of incident:On 04/18/16 at approximately 7:04PM the suspect, a black male wearing dark clothes, entered the Family Dollar and loitered near the front of the store and asked customers and an employee for any cash donations that they could spare for him.  At approximately 7:08PM the suspect approached employee Rodney Price, who was working at cash register #1, and when Price tried speaking to the suspect he was ignored.  Price stated that the suspect appeared distant and had heavily blood shot eyes.  The suspect then gestured to a pack of chewing gum that was on a rack in front of the cash register counter, and he asked how much the gum cost.  Rodney Price advised the suspect that the gum cost 36 cents, and the suspect then acted as though he was going to purchase the gum and provided Rodney Price with 50 cents.  When Rodney Price opened the cash register drawer the suspect suddenly lunged over the counter and reached into the opened drawer.  The suspect was able to obtain 1 twenty dollar bill from the cash register, but was blocked by Rodney Price and store manager Walter Parker from removing any additional cash.  Both Rodney Price and manager Walter Parker held the suspects arms down on the counter preventing him from reaching further into the drawer.  After pulling away from the counter, the suspect fled the area on foot, exiting that store at approximately 7:08PM.  When questioned about the suspect, the Family Dollar employees stated that the suspect did not appear familiar to them and they do not believe he was a regular customer.  Rodney Price stated that he had observed the suspect yesterday evening (on 04/17/16) panhandling at a nearby Popeye's Chicken restaurant located at 683 Boulevard NE.  The crime scene at the Family Dollar was print processed and photographed by APD ID Tech 7342 (Lewis).  This incident was filmed on several security video cameras (timestamp is approx. 2 minutes fast) and the point of contact for the footage is store manager Mahama Virgel (404-934-0486).  No persons reported any injuries from this incident.Suspect Description:Black male, medium complexion, age 24 to 30, 6'00" to 6'03" with a slim to medium build with a full beard / goatee.  The suspect was wearing a black jacket, dark jeans, a black t-shirt, black shoes with a white stripe and white trim (possibly Fila brand) and a black and white 'trucker' style baseball cap (black in the front, white on the rear).Additional Information: At approximately 8:20PM the same suspect from this Family Dollar robbery entered the Waffle House at 112 Courtland Street NE and begged employees and customers for money.  After loitering inside and outside of the Waffle House for about 15 minutes, the suspect purchased a Sprite soda.  When the female Waffle House employee opened the cash register drawer, the suspect reached over the counter and stole approximately $170.00 in paper cash.  The suspect fled on foot and is believed to have dropped his hat while running from the scene (same hat he wore during the Family Dollar robbery).

The suspect, later identified as Lamar Poss, would enter a business or restaurant and would make a small purchase or ask to change a bill then would suddenly lunge over the check-out counter and reach into the cash register drawer and snatch paper currency then flee the area on foot.  The robbery incidents that have been linked to Lamar Poss include:-Case 161070763 (CVS at 235 Peachtree Street on 04/16/16; classed as a Disorderly Conduct)-Case 161072582 (Burger King at 386 North Avenue on 04/16/16; assigned to Zone 6 CID)-Case 161080330 (Walgreens at 595 Piedmont Avenue on 04/17/16; assigned to Zone 6 CID)-Case 161092715 (Family Dollar at 455 North Avenue on 04/18/16)-Case 161092893 (Waffle House at 112 Courtland Street on 04/18/16)-Case 161361778 (Taco Bell at 429 Ponce de Leon Ave on 05/15/16)-Case 161362184 (McDonald's at 80 Jesse Hill Jr Drive on 05/15/16)-Case 161362500 (BP gas station at 610 Spring Street on 05/15/16)-Case 161370863 (CVS at 439 Highland Avenue NE on 05/16/16)Departmental bulletins containing images of the suspect (prior to his identification) were issued via city email on 04/18/16 and again on 05/15/16.  Approximately two hours after the last robbery occurred (the incident at the CVS at 439 Highland Avenue NE on 05/16/16) officers working a detail at Renaissance Park (501 Piedmont Avenue) observed the suspect walking and recognized him from the email bulletins and from the clothing description that was aired on police radio reference the CVS robbery on Highland Avenue that had occurred a short time earlier.  The suspect was detained and subsequently identified as Lamar Boris Poss with a date of birth of 05/02/85 (see supplemental report by Officer Bursby under case 161370863 for additional details).  After being detained Lamar Poss was transported to Atlanta Police Headquarters and was placed in an interview room (Interview 1).  The interview room is video and audio monitored and recorded.  Lamar Poss was read his Constitutional Rights verbatim from a departmental form and both verbally and in writing acknowledged that he was willing to make a statement to police.  During the first part of the interview Lamar Poss spoke with Inv. Gilliard and Inv. Foster of the Commercial Robbery Unit, and Poss confessed to robbing the CVS located at 439 Highland Avenue NE earlier in the day.  Lamar Poss was questioned about several other incidents but initially denied involvement.

Poss believed that he was committing a "misdemeanor" when he snatched money from the cash drawers, and described specifics of each incident that could only be known by the perpetrator.  When asked about the Family Dollar incident (455 North Ave) and the Waffle House incident (112 Courtland) that occurred on 04/18/16, Lamar Poss described that during the Family Dollar incident he purchased a pack of chewing gum in order to gain access to the cash register drawer (this is consistent with the facts of the incident).

Before attempting to awaken the driver, I ensured that his path of travel was clear from any persons or vehicles. I then requested for EMS and a wrecker to be in route to the location. The dispatcher was then advised that the driver was unresponsive however, he did display signs of breathing. Supervisor Unit 1193 (Mack) and Unit 1105 (J.

We continued to do so up until Grady Unit 388 arrived on scene and yet the driver had still not awakened. The Grady Unit also identified that the driver was also breathing due to the movement from his chest but, since we could not get the driver to respond after tapping on the window, shaking the vehicle or activating lights and sirens; EMS suggested that we smashed one of the windows to gain access to the driver. Before damaging the window due to exigent circumstances, we again attempted to open all 4 car doors and they were still locked and secured. EMS did believe that it would be ideal not wait any longer for a wrecker service to gain access into the vehicle since the driver's true medical condition was still unknown.The front passenger side window was then smashed open to unlock the vehicle doors and recover the unresponsive driver after shifting the vehicle in Park, so that EMS could check his vitals. The driver was later identified as Mr. Robinson, Deanthony (DOB 10/28/1991). While EMS was attempting to gather information from Mr. Robinson, he was delayed in his responses with slurred speech and redness in both eyes. Due to the nature his behaviors, physical appearance and unresponsiveness for approximately 30 minutes - the driver was placed in custody and transported to Grady Detention for DUI - Less Safe (OCGA 40-6-391) and No Seat Belt (OCGA 40-8-76.1).

All recovered items were turned into property while the arrestee was provided a property receipt, which he signed. The vehicle sustained damages to the front passenger side window. The vehicle was impounded from the incident location by S&W Towing.Supervisor Unit 1193 (Mack), Unit 1105 (J. Smith), Unit 1101 (W. Graham), Unit 1108 (McComas) were on scene.

Upon arrival, I spoke to EMS (Unit #354) who informed me that one of the drivers involved in the accident seems to be intoxicated due to his slurred speech and that his passenger is complaining of injuries. I approached all parties initially asking if they need medical attention. Ms. Cathy Starr (Passenger of Driver #1) stated that her "foot and side is hurting". Both drivers stated that they are not injured. Upon greeting Ms. Cathy Starr and asking furthermore about her injuries, she started to get loud, angry and agitated with me. I immediately smelled alcohol coming out of her breath and her inability to answer my questions. Ms. Cathy Starr was treated by EMS (Unit 354) and transported to Grady for her injuries. I then spoke to Driver #2 who stated that he was driving East on North Avenue and that he had the green light and all the sudden he saw a red pick-up truck get in the middle of the intersection trying to make a left turn.

I observed Mr. Randy Starr walking to his vehicle with lack of balance and struggled while getting back out of his vehicle.  Mr. Randy Starr provided me with his license and a copy of his insurance payment.  I asked Mr. Randy Starr what happened; he explained to me that he was trying to make a left turn and the car just hit him. It was extremely difficult to understand what Mr. Randy Starr was saying due his slurred speech. Mr. Randy Starr had a slow respond to my questions and was unable to concentrate on the questions I was asking him. For example: I asked Mr. Randy Starr what is his relationship to the passenger in his vehicle. Mr. Randy Starr started pointing East on North Avenue and saying "It was his fault, I did not do anything." Throughout my whole conversation with Mr. Randy Starr he was unable to maintain good coordination while standing and had bloodshot eyes, more so on the left eye. Therefore, I asked Mr. Randy Starr if he had anything to drink tonight. Mr. Randy Starr replied "I had one beer like three hours ago." I then asked Mr. Randy Starr if that is all he had, he then replied: "Yea, I only had one beer like four or five hours ago." Approximately 1123pm Mr. Randy Starr was detained and I read his GA Implied Consent Notice. Mr. Randy Starr agreed, but a few seconds after he started getting loud and stating "Why you are not getting him too, is it because he is White." I then asked Mr. Randy Starr to have respect towards me because I am not yelling at him.  I repeated the question to Mr. Randy Starr, which he once again agreed and said "sorry sweetheart".  Both vehicles were not drivable and were towed by A-Tow. Driver #2 was provided with the case number and informed on how to obtain a copy of his report. I then headed to 879 Hemphill Ave NW (Georgia Tech) to have the test administer to Mr. Randy Starr. Upon arrival, I met with Officer Franklin (Unit 1507) to assist me. Once Mr. Randy Starr was inside of the above location, he started to use profanity: "Fuck you, I am not taking any test." "You can't make me" "I will have my license back by tomorrow" "You motherfucking faggot" and so on.  The Georgia Tech Officer was preparing the breathalyzer machine for Mr. Randy Starr, but in the meantime Mr. Randy Starr kept using abusive language and trying to touch Officer Franklin with his mouth and saying "You have a big butt, what you going to do to me." Once the breathalyzer was ready, Mr. Randy Star

153283130	4	I, Detective Etterle, was investigating case 151983205. In doing so, I interviewed Ms. Helethia Banks regarding a possible child cruelty case. Ms. Banks disclosed allegations of domestic violence and rape against Mr. Walter Grogan (the prime suspect of the child cruelty case 151983205).On 11.24.15, around 1745 hours, Ms. Banks came to PSHQ. I conducted an interview with Ms. Banks in Witness Room 4, which was audibly and visually recorded. I read Ms. Banks her Miranda Rights. After acknowledging them, she waived her right to counsel and chose to speak with me. Based on this interview and additional telephonic interviews, Ms. Banks advised the following:She advised she began dating Mr. Grogan in November 2013. They moved in together on March 14, 2014 at 537 Boulevard NE Atlanta, GA 30308 Apt 202. Ms. Banks found out she was pregnant with Aiden Banks (a.k.a. Aiden Grogan) in August 2014. She advised Mr. Grogan's demeanor toward her changed when he found out she was pregnant. She advised he began acting more possessive, angry, unwanting of her and the baby, and demanding amongst other things. Mr. Grogan would become irate over things such as Ms. Banks visiting her family or going out without him. Aiden was born on 04.09.15. Ms. Banks recalled an incident in June where she attempted to call a nurse to ask a question about Aiden's right eye (which had a scratch across it). Mr. Grogan became upset with her for using the phone and trying to call for advice. When he became upset, he kicked her (unsure which leg he used) on the right side of her abdomen. He kicked her one other time on another unspecified occasion. Ms. Banks advised that he became verbally abusive and stated things such as, "Bitch, I hope you die." and "I am going to kill somebody today. You and Aiden will be a witness." Among all this, Ms. Banks advised that after Mr. Grogan found out she was pregnant, he forced her to have sex often--nearly every night. She told him every time that she did not want to have any sex, but he threatened her by using "blackmail." She explained that she was on subsidized housing. She paid the bills to the lease to her apartment. Only Ms. Banks and Aiden were on the lease and Mr. Grogan was not allowed to be there. He threatened to report her to the leasing office, and Ms. Banks feared she would lose her apartment. Ms. Banks advised she also feared Mr. Grogan might do something to hurt her if she did not have sex with him. She advised one incident in particular being the day that Aiden had the episode of the seizure (07/15/15 or 07/16/15) where Mr. Grogan forced her to have sex. Earlier in the day, she was sitting on the couch with Aiden when Mr. Grogan walked over to her and forcer her to have sex. She stated he pulled her pants off, pushed her down on the couch by placing his two hands on her chest, forced her legs open, and penetrated her vagina with his penis. She told him "No," and stated she did not want to have sex. She asked, "Why are you doing this to me [paraphrased]?" He ignored and continued to have sex. When he was done, she was not sure if he ejaculated. The assault lasted for "a few minutes."She advised that Mr. Grogan sometimes has difficulty becoming erect and/or ejaculating during sex. Ms. Banks also advised that she believed Mr. Grogan forced her to have sex nearly every night because she was already pregnant. She advised that after she delivered Aiden, he forced her to have sex before she fully healed from the delivery.Ms. Banks advised that she did not report these incidents because she was fearful of what Mr. Grogan might do.

153283130	4	I, Detective Etterle, was investigating case 151983205. In doing so, I interviewed Ms. Helethia Banks regarding a possible child cruelty case. Ms. Banks disclosed allegations of domestic violence and rape against Mr. Walter Grogan (the prime suspect of the child cruelty case 151983205).On 11.24.15, around 1745 hours, Ms. Banks came to PSHQ. I conducted an interview with Ms. Banks in Witness Room 4, which was audibly and visually recorded. I read Ms. Banks her Miranda Rights. After acknowledging them, she waived her right to counsel and chose to speak with me. Based on this interview and additional telephonic interviews, Ms. Banks advised the following:She advised she began dating Mr. Grogan in November 2013. They moved in together on March 14, 2014 at 537 Boulevard NE Atlanta, GA 30308 Apt 202. Ms. Banks found out she was pregnant with Aiden Banks (a.k.a. Aiden Grogan) in August 2014. She advised Mr. Grogan's demeanor toward her changed when he found out she was pregnant. She advised he began acting more possessive, angry, unwanting of her and the baby, and demanding amongst other things. Mr. Grogan would become irate over things such as Ms. Banks visiting her family or going out without him. Aiden was born on 04.09.15. Ms. Banks recalled an incident in June where she attempted to call a nurse to ask a question about Aiden's right eye (which had a scratch across it). Mr. Grogan became upset with her for using the phone and trying to call for advice. When he became upset, he kicked her (unsure which leg he used) on the right side of her abdomen. He kicked her one other time on another unspecified occasion. Ms. Banks advised that he became verbally abusive and stated things such as, "Bitch, I hope you die." and "I am going to kill somebody today. You and Aiden will be a witness." Among all this, Ms. Banks advised that after Mr. Grogan found out she was pregnant, he forced her to have sex often--nearly every night. She told him every time that she did not want to have any sex, but he threatened her by using "blackmail." She explained that she was on subsidized housing. She paid the bills to the lease to her apartment. Only Ms. Banks and Aiden were on the lease and Mr. Grogan was not allowed to be there. He threatened to report her to the leasing office, and Ms. Banks feared she would lose her apartment. Ms. Banks advised she also feared Mr. Grogan might do something to hurt her if she did not have sex with him. She advised one incident in particular being the day that Aiden had the episode of the seizure (07/15/15 or 07/16/15) where Mr. Grogan forced her to have sex. Earlier in the day, she was sitting on the couch with Aiden when Mr. Grogan walked over to her and forcer her to have sex. She stated he pulled her pants off, pushed her down on the couch by placing his two hands on her chest, forced her legs open, and penetrated her vagina with his penis. She told him "No," and stated she did not want to have sex. She asked, "Why are you doing this to me [paraphrased]?" He ignored and continued to have sex. When he was done, she was not sure if he ejaculated. The assault lasted for "a few minutes."She advised that Mr. Grogan sometimes has difficulty becoming erect and/or ejaculating during sex. Ms. Banks also advised that she believed Mr. Grogan forced her to have sex nearly every night because she was already pregnant. She advised that after she delivered Aiden, he forced her to have sex before she fully healed from the delivery.Ms. Banks advised that she did not report these incidents because she was fearful of what Mr. Grogan might do. She advised she was embarrassed and ashamed that the sexual, physical, and verbal assaults were occurring.Ms. Banks advised that Mr. Grogan has only been arrested one time for drugs. She stated she paid all the bills and all the expenses in the household. Mr. Grogan has only given her $100 throughout the whole time they were together. Ms. Banks walks with

160300479	4	On January 30, 2016 at approximately 2:53am, I, OFC J. THOMPSON IV, was driving southbound on I-85 SB Expressway near the 17th Street NW exit ramp. I observed a white 2013 Kia Optima (GA Tag: CDD8552) driving in front of me without its lights on and its left turn signal activated. I also observed the Kia failing to maintain lane. I continued to drive behind the Kia for a short amount of time. I then activated the emergency equipment on my marked patrol vehicle (32431) to initiate a traffic stop. The vehicle pulled over into the right shoulder and stopped near the North Avenue NW exit ramp. I exited my marked patrol vehicle and approached the driver's side window of the Kia. I asked the driver, identified as Bruce WILLIAMS (B/M, DOB: 03/08/70; ARRESTEE), for his driver's license, which he provided. I informed Bruce WILLIAMS as to the reason why he was stopped. I asked Bruce WILLIAMS where he was coming from. Bruce WILLIAMS stated “A friend of mine's.” I asked Bruce WILLIAMS what he'd had to drink. Bruce WILLIAMS stated “Nothing.” I asked Bruce WILLIAMS if he was taking any medications. Bruce WILLIAMS advised that he was HIV positive and was taking HIV medication. I asked Bruce WILLIAMS if he had any other medical conditions. Bruce WILLIAMS advised that he did not have any other medical conditions. I asked Bruce WILLIAMS if he wore glasses or contacts. Bruce WILLIAMS advised that he was currently wearing contacts. While speaking with Bruce WILLIAMS, I could smell an odor of alcoholic beverages emanating from his breath. I also observed that his eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred. After speaking with Bruce WILLIAMS, I returned to my marked patrol vehicle. I de-activated the front flashing blue lights and backed my patrol vehicle up to create additional space. I exited my patrol vehicle and re-approached the driver's side window of the Kia. I asked Bruce WILLIAMS to step out of his vehicle. Bruce WILLIAMS complied with my request. I informed Bruce WILLIAMS that I wanted to make sure that he was safe to operate his vehicle. The first evaluation Bruce WILLIAMS performed was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus evaluation. I instructed Bruce WILLIAMS to stand with his feet together with his arms down by his sides. I instructed Bruce WILLIAMS to focus on the tip of my stimulus (which was held approximately twelve to fifteen inches from his face and slightly above eye level) and to follow it with his eyes without moving his head. I asked Bruce WILLIAMS if he understood the instructions. Bruce WILLIAMS acknowledged that he understood the instructions. I checked to make sure that Bruce WILLIAMS's pupils were equal in size and that his eyes were tracking equally. I observed nystagmus in both the left and right eye while checking for lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation and an angle of onset of approximately thirty-five degrees. During the evaluation, I had to remind Bruce WILLIAMS to focus on the stimulus. I observed all six clues during this evaluation. The second evaluation Bruce WILLIAMS performed was the Walk and Turn evaluation. I instructed Bruce WILLIAMS to imagine a straight line on the pavement in front of him. I instructed Bruce WILLIAMS to place his left foot on that line. I then instructed Bruce WILLIAMS to place his right heel against his left toe with his arms down by his sides. Bruce WILLIAMS attempted to assume the starting position. Bruce WILLIAMS advised me that he is double jointed and had a hip replacement. I asked Bruce WILLIAMS if he would be willing to continue with the evaluation. Bruce WILLIAMS advised that he would be willing to continue the evaluation. I again gave Bruce WILLIAMS the instructions for the starting position. Once Bruce WILLIAMS assumed the starting position, I instructed him to not start before instructed to do so and to remain in this particular position until instructed to start. I asked Bruce WILLIAMS if he understood the instructions. Bruc

I observed nystagmus in both the left and right eye while checking for lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation and an angle of onset of approximately forty degrees. During the evaluation, I had to remind Ana CARMONA multiple times to not move her head. I observed all six clues during this evaluation.The second evaluation Ana CARMONA performed was the Walk and Turn evaluation. Before giving Ana CARMONA any instructions, I gave her the option to remove her boots. Ana CARMONA opted to leave her boots on. I instructed Ana CARMONA to imagine a straight line on the pavement in front of her. I instructed Ana CARMONA to place her left foot on that line. I then instructed Ana CARMONA to place her right heel against her left toe with her arms down by her sides. I instructed Ana CARMONA to not start before instructed to do so and to remain in this particular position until instructed to start. I asked Ana CARMONA if she understood the instructions.

160100279	4	On 1-10-2016 at 2:00am Ofc J. Larca and myself Ofc V. Butler conducted a traffic stop on a Black Chevrolet Impala (Ga Tag CCU3688) for having suspended registration. After blue lighting the vehicle which travelled westbound on North Ave Ne towards Northside Dr Nw, the driver Rodrickus Robinson failed to pull his vehicle over right away. Mr. Robinson never increased his speed but it was evident that he was ignoring the blue lights and sirens that were activated behind him. Additionally I Ofc V. Butler could see that there was a lot of movement from the driver Mr. Robinson and passenger Shantway Barnes. Shortly after Mr. Robinson pulled his vehicle over and myself and Ofc Larca then approached. While walking to the driver side of the vehicle I began to smell the odor of marijuana as Mr. Robinson now had his window down. Ofc Larca additionally advised he could smell the odor as well. I later made contact with Mr. Robinson and asked why it took him so long to pull over and he stated he was getting ready to. I then advised to him I smelled the odor of marijuana coming from his vehicle and believed this was the reason he took his time to stop. I then asked Mr. Robinson and Ms. Barnes out of the vehicle so I could speak with them in reference to the odor of marijuana. After speaking to them both, Ms. Barnes stated the marijuana was inside of her purse that she was holding. I then told her to retrieve it for me and she was unable to locate it. She later advised the marijuana was inside of a cigarello bag that was inside of the vehicle. I then asked them both if there were any weapons in the vehicle and Mr. Robinson stated none at all. Ofc Larca then watched both subjects as I looked inside the vehicle for the narcotics. I later recovered the cigarello bag (Dutch Masters Brand) which was up under the passenger side seat which contained a small baggie of marijuana weighing 1.1 grams. I also observed a firearm which was up under the passenger side seat remembering that Mr. Robinson previously stated there were no weapons in the vehicle at all.

They stated they were parked in their vehicle in a parking space and eating at the Varsity when a gray Ford Focus which was driven by the offender DYE, Patricia Lynn (1157 Jefferson Ave. East Point GA 404-766-0896) backed into them.  Harris and Hammonds stated Dye offered to pay them off so they would call the police for a report.    Harris and Hammonds stated Dye appeared to be intoxicated.  When they called the police, Dye became belligerent and began throwing her property around the parking lot.  When I spoke to Dye, I could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from her breath.  She stumbled and swayed while standing in place.  I asked Dye what happened.  Dye stated she was having difficulty seeing because of the rain.  I then asked Dye how much alcohol she had consumed prior to the accident.  Dye stated she consumed two "Manhattan" drinks at her retirement party.  She stated she left the party around 2100 hrs.  I gave Hammonds a case number for the accident report.  I then asked Dye to perform some standardized field sobriety tests for me and she agreed.  I first made sure she wasn't wearing contact lenses or had any physical ailments that would prevent her from performing the tests.  I first performed the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test on Dye.  Dye's eyes displayed six clues with nystagmus showing in both eyes in all three phases of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test.  I then attempted to conduct the walk and turn test.  Dye attempted to began the test before being told to do so.  She had to raise her arms more than six inches during the instructional stage.  She was also swaying and losing her balance during the instructional stage.  After giving her the instructions, Dye would take approximately three steps before nearly falling down.  Dye stated she could no longer perform the tests.  I advised Dye that she was being placed under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol.  Dye insisted she could perform the test.  I allowed Dye to attempt the test a second time.  After giving Dye the instructions again, she proceeded to walk with her arms raised more than six inches from her sides, she missed her heel to toe steps, walked offline, and took too many steps.  Dye was unable to complete the test a second time.  I advised Dye she was being placed under arrest again.  I placed both sets of my handcuffs on Dye's wrists because of her lack of flexibility.  I checked the handcuffs for proper fitting and double locked them to ensure they didn't tighten up on her wrists.  I placed Dye in the back seat of my patrol car and read Dye the Georgia Implied Consent Notice for subjects over 21 years old.  Dye agreed to take a state administered breath test on the Intoxilyzer 9000 located at the Georgia Tech Police Department.   I attempted to allow Dye to allow somebody to come get the vehicle but she wouldn't tell me who I could call to get the vehicle.  I secured her vehicle and brought the keys with me to the jail.  She would only cry.  After a female officer arrived on the scene to search Dye, I transported Dye to the Georgia Tech Police Department.  The entire trip to the police department, Dye was extremely belligerent.  She shouted profanities towards me and cried loudly in the back seat of my patrol car.  Upon my arrival at the police department, I administered the breath test.  Dye's first breath sample was .122 grams and her second sample was .132 grams.  I then transported Dye to the city jail.  The entire trip to the city jail, Dye cried and complained of her wrists hurting.  I advised Dye I would pull over and check the handcuffs but she cursed and me and yelled at me to keep driving.  U
