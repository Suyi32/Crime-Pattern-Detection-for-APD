On 11/29/16 a resident from 1052 Coronado called 911 at approximately 1014am stating there was an unknown Black male in the rear of her home.  The victim stated it was a bald heavy set male with a blue sweater or pull over on with gray pants on.  The caller told 911 the male got out of a large Black pickup truck and was looking into her garage windows.  The caller stated the subject made eye contact with her and got back into the truck and left.  911 dispatched the call at 1016am.  I was in the area off Sentinel post Rd when the call came up.  I was on the phone speaking with the neighborhood Association president in regards to an unrelated issue.  The president lives on the same street as the 911 call.  I asked her to look across the street and see if she sees anything.  She stated she saw an overweight bald black male walking from the front door and get into a Black Dodge Ram that was backed into the driveway.  She stated it all appeared to be normal because there was dry cleaning hanging on the front door and a UPS like package on the porch.  She stated she figured if it was a thief he would have taken the package.  She stated she thought maybe he was dropping off the dry cleaning.  I asked her to get the tag number if she could.  She followed behind the vehicle as it exited the driveway and provided a tag out of California 63057H1.Approximately 3 to 5 minutes later I arrived at 1052 Coronado and spoke with the 911 caller, Michele Joyce.  She explained to me that she saw a large Black pickup truck pull down her driveway and behind her home.  She stated a larger Black male exited the truck and started looking into her garage windows.  She stated she looked out her bedroom window and made eye contact with the subject.  She stated the subject got back into the truck and left.  This was at approximately 1015am.  It was approximately 1016am when the witness saw the same truck( Black pickup driven by a Black male) backed into the driveway at 1026 Coronado which is 2 houses down from the 911 callers home.I ran the tag provided and it came back to a 2016 Black Dodge Ram registered to PV Holdings which is Avis rental cars.  I got in contact with Peter Duca with Avis security and provided him the tag info.  He confirmed the vehicle belonged to Avis and provided renter information.  He stated it was checked out on 11/28/16 and due back on 11/29/16.  He provided a name of Jalim Hamlett GA DL#032173388.  I requested a 6 person photo line up from the Department of Driver Services.  On 11/29/16 I went to the witnesses residence along with Sgt Jackson who has no knowledge of the suspect.  Sgt Jackson presented the Atlanta Police photo line up Admonition to the witness.  The witness read it and signed it.  The line up was given to her by Sgt Jackson and the witness picked out Jalim Hamlett within a few seconds of viewing the line up.	163341048
